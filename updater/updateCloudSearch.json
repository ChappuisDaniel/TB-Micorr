The science of materials, because it is right there, in the very nature of the material where all the aesthetic, historical and cultural values associated with this metal are born; art, because they are mainly artistic objects as opposed to everyday objects, those that gather the culture\u2014understood as all human activity\u2014from each era, and transfer that information to new generations; and philosophy, because it takes a reflexive thought, which allows the approach to the metal from a different perspective that interlaces the human and the scientific with its own material nature.There have been various methods developed over the course of history to understand the material and the phenomena associated with it. However, it could be said that in the current paradigm of knowledge, the physicochemical, metallurgical and mechanical phenomena of metals are studied with the scientific method, which is based upon experimentation, measurement and on the repeatability and refutation of its results. In turn, the aesthetic, symbolic, historical and iconographic properties of metals have been studied with various hermeneutical methods, which are based upon all knowledge being the result of interpretation.These two methods propose time-based studies that contradict the immediacy and variability of a phenomenon, such as the poetic image, which occurs in the human psyche in a sudden manner and which can also affect other souls, Other hearts, in spite of all the barriers that reason can impose. For this reason, it is necessary to come at this from the phenomenological method, which studies the phenomena as they are presented as well as the way in which they are lived by each person. This method allows us to consider the emergence of the image in an individual consciousness, to be able to restore the subjectivity of the image and to measure its amplitude, strength and sense its transubjectivity.The analysis of the construction of the poetic image of bronze will start from the phenomenological studies made by Gaston Bachelard (France 1884\u20131962. Philosopher, critic, epistemologist, scientist and poet), about the image that arises in the consciousness from reading a poem, where the poet provides images never before imagined by the reader, making him marvel at the very moment in an innocent way and, by activating the participation of the creating image, a poetic image emerges [1].However, knowing the poetic image of a material requires a method that allows us to take the very moment in which an object constituted of that material suddenly appears before a person, who immediately builds in his psyche an image independent of his own preferences, of the intentions of the artist, of the references to the forms of the object and the history of the material itself.We will begin by saying that the physicochemical, mechanical and metallurgical properties of bronze made its use expand with the most diverse applications and that the interaction between humans and metals, especially bronze, gave rise to the generation of myths, symbols and metallurgical archetypes, understanding the concept of archetype as proposed by Carl Gustav Jung and that Gaston Bachelard also uses:\n\u201c\u2026 a series of images that summarize the ancestral experience of man in the face of a typical situation, within circumstances that are not particular to a single individual, but can be imposed on every man\u201d [2].\n\nHowever, changes in human interests and in the material constitution of bronze as a result of interaction with the environment, generate new experiences with this metal that activate the human psyche to enrich and renew the bank of images that give shape to that metallurgical archetype, which interweaves its particular features as the scarcity of its raw materials and metallurgical difficulties for its production, with cultural values such as \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201celitist\u201d and resistance to corrosion, with values such as \u201cperenniality\u201d.Thus, unlike archetypal images, the poetic image arises when there is an immediate astonishment of the psyche, which has no past, which derives from a direct ontology, which is not caused by archetypes asleep in the unconscious, and as Bachelard says:\n\n\u201cOn the contrary: through the brilliance of an image, the distant past resounds with echoes, and it is hard to know at what depth these echoes will reverberate and die away. Because of its novelty and its action, the poetic image has an entity and dynamism of its own;\u201d [3, p. 8].\n\nAnd Bachelard continues:\n\n\u201c\u2026that is, in reverberation that I think we find the real measure of the being of a poetic image\u2026. In this reverberation, the poetic image will have sonority of being.\u201d [3, p. 8].\n\nHowever, to explain this unexpected character, suddenly rising out of a new poetic image and the way it affects the one who observes a sculpture, it becomes necessary to pose a phenomenology of the imagination, understanding for this:\n\n\u2026\u201ca study of the phenomenon of the poetic image when it emerges into the consciousness as a direct product of the heart, soul and being of man, apprehended in his actuality\u201d. [3, p. 9].\n\nThus, this study aims to show the characteristics of bronze that contributed to the construction of its metallurgical archetype, demonstrating with the history of its use mainly in Colombian art, the process of evolution of this archetype.Of the four characteristics that will be explained later, it is found that the patina that has per se aesthetic values and historical contributors to the formation of the archetypal bronze image related to perenniality, is precisely the quality of the material that presents the blow to the spectator, being constituted in fundamental part of the image that projects the work and therefore of what it communicates.Thus, as a bronze sculpture is an inanimate object, it is precisely the patina that allows the emergence of new poetic images of the work, allowing the emergence of individual and intimate affectation, independent of previous knowledge in metallurgy and art and much more, of all the intentions of the artist.\nThe bronze in Colombian sculptureAs described by Pliny the Elder in his book XXIV of Natural History, the Greeks were the ones who initiated the tradition of highlighting and perpetuating the memory and values of the winners of the Olympic Games and making them into examples for communities through the statues of bronze. Pliny also says that perhaps the first public statue that was erected at the expense of the Athenians was that of the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogiton (The Assassination of Hipparchus of Athens, 514 BCE) and that from here, this practice was later universally adopted to adorn the squares of all cities.Following the Greek tradition inherited through the Spaniards, the first appearances of bronze monuments in Colombian public space took place in the process of conformation of the new republic where, in order to preserve the legacy and the memory of the heroes and dignitaries of independence and outstanding men of the country, were erected statues of personages like Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Francisco de Paula Santander and Atanasio Girardot, among many others.However, this type of orders was requested by the ruling classes whose preferred artistic style was Neoclassicism, limiting the plastic expression of the sculptors and making them fall into formal repetition. On the other hand, the theme always focused on highlighting these important personages and finally, the costs of production were too high as the country\u2019s technological development, specifically for the bronze foundries, was in very precarious conditions, there was also a greater interest in developing iron metallurgy [4].As if this were not enough, the commissions were always given to foreign artists who came to Colombia as sculpture teachers such as Ra\u00fal Carlos Verlet, C\u00e9sar Sighinolfi and Luigi Ramelli, among many others [5].Thus, the lack of knowledge of the metallurgy of bronze at the high level required for the production of the statues made it almost impossible to create a company capable of sustaining this in the national territory. Perhaps the first experience of this type was the production of the bust of Atanasio Girardot, modeled and fused by Francisco Antonio Cano in the Estrella de Velilla and Escobar workshops in 1910 [6].One of the most outstanding students of Francisco Antonio Cano was Marco Tob\u00f3n Mej\u00eda, [5], who developed all his work from Paris, where he also opened a foundry workshop and produced, among other works, the statue of Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez modeled by Francisco Antonio Cano, One of the few monuments made by a Colombian artist at the beginning of the 20th century.Following the path laid out by Cano and Tob\u00f3n, it would be Bernardo Vieco who would establish the first bronze foundry in the country after his trip to Europe, where he learned different techniques that he could contextualize in the country\u2019s technological situation of the time, adjusting the procedures to match locally available resources. Vieco\u2019s implementations included the production of molds in Portland cement and the adjustment of the furnace to Bogota\u2019s environmental conditions for the bronze smelting, with which he was able to efficiently produce large-format sculptures and several methods of casting that allowed him to optimize the available resources, making him a specialist in this area on the national level [7].Outstanding students of Vieco were Jorge Mar\u00edn and Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt, who began in the trade of bronze casting and sculptural production, the second being one of the most important sculptors in Antioquia and Colombia due to his monumental commemorative sculptures executed through official contracts.Later the bronze has been used by different Colombian artists as can be seen in Fig.\u00a01, who have made their productions in national workshops such as El Sembrador de estrellas by Alonso R\u00edos and the Thinker by Nad\u00edn Ospina, among others. However, a few like Fernando Botero do all their production in Italy.\n\nFig.\u00a01\n\na\nEl Sembrador de estrellas of Alonso R\u00edos, cast and placed in the Faculty of Engineering of the Universidad de Antioquia, Medell\u00edn campus, 1994. b\nEl Pensador of Nad\u00edn Ospina cast in the workshop of Luis Eduardo Castillo located in the city of Bogot\u00e1, 2009. c\nP\u00e1jaro of Fernando Botero cast in Italy and placed in the Parque de San Antonio in the city of Medell\u00edn, 1994\n\n\nCharacteristics of bronze contributing to the formation of its poetic imageAs can be seen, bronze has been positioned throughout the history of mankind as a depository and communicator of the values of illustrious characters, models for humanity, from Greek times until today, being filled with symbolic, historical and poetic values that lie in its physico-chemical, metallurgical and mechanical characteristics.\nThe first of these characteristics is the shortage of the raw materials for the production of bronze whose base metal is copper, being traditionally alloyed with tin, lead and zinc. The latter is also the main alloy to produce brass (Cu\u2013Zn), which is sometimes used for the production of large format sculptures.\nThe second characteristic is the metallurgical difficulty of the processes of casting bronze which results in a large number of defects that contribute to the detriment of the sculptures.\nThe third characteristic is the possibility of recasting bronze objects with a low loss of alloys or even with the possibility to modify it to make different objects such as bells, cannons and statues that require different properties. This also contributes to the consolidation of bronze as a perennial material. In the ancient world bronze was a very precious commodity, so the sculptures made in this or other metals often disappeared when melted by conquering nations or a later ruler who was not interested in the art of his predecessor. That is why very few large bronze sculptures survived from those produced in antiquity [8].In Colombia there have been two types of attacks on bronze sculptures, the first one is related to its economic value, which as explained above is high, making these works, mainly those in public spaces, very attractive for criminals who steal them in, either entirely as in the case of the works of Jorge Mar\u00edn Vieco [9] or partially as in the case of the whiskers from Fernando Botero\u2019s Gato [10].On the other hand and more interesting from the symbolic and poetic point of view of bronze works are the deliberate attacks against some monuments with intentions of political retaliation in times of social tension where busts and statues of political leaders have been torn down, blown up and even melted by their detractors, such as the monument to Jorge Eliecer Gait\u00e1n [11].\nThe fourth characteristic and perhaps the most determinant in the poetic image of bronze is its interaction with the environment in which it is immersed, inducing a chemical transformation from the surface to the inside. This process known as corrosion has several causes in metals, mainly acid rain, environmental pollution (smoke, particulate matter), the excrement of birds and other living organisms, thermal shock and vandalism.Specifically in bronze, the corrosion products form a layer that in the majority of cases adheres to the surface of the sculpture called patina, which can be natural or artificial and serves to cover up the manufacturing processes, protect the base metal, give the desired appearance to the sculpture and also collects evidence of the history of the work and the environments to which it has been exposed [12].The corrosion products most frequently found in bronze sculptures located in urban centers are cooper oxides such as cuprite (Cu2O) and tenorite (CuO) [13], copper sulphates such as brochantite Cu4SO4 (OH)6 [12], and copper chlorides such as atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3 and paratacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)2).Traditionally for the sculptures in public spaces, artificial patinas of homogeneous color applied throughout its surface, which correspond to the aesthetic values that the artist wants to give to the work, are frequently used. The colors and textures of these patinas depend on the chemical composition of the metal, the chemical reagents used, the temperature and the application methodologies. However, when a patina is exposed to the environment it undergoes a new transformation as a result of natural or anthropic processes and the passage of time, forming a unique layer that is what finally determines the perception we have of bronze objects. Under certain environmental and care conditions, the artificial patinas are preserved, but in the great majority of cases that we observe in Colombian sculptures in public space, the patina becomes a function of the corrosion products that have been generated.Thus, the patina of bronze gives the work an aesthetic value and a historical value. Some positions suggest that the patina would be an integral part of the aesthetic value of a work only in the cases in which the sculptor has foreseen this. In those cases where it has formed naturally, independent of its beauty, it possesses only a historical value of an extra-artistic nature, which in theory may even be incompatible with the correct reading of the work [12]. On the other hand, the Carta de Restauro of 1987, emphasizes the preservation of patina in restoration processes, as long as the patina really protects the metal, so that the antiquity of the work can be perceived, that is to say it gives aesthetic value to the transformations of the material [14].\nExperimental study of the patina of the sculpture la piedad of bernardo vieco\nDescription of the analyzed statue\nAs a case study, an analysis was done of the funerary sculpture La Piedad (1950) by Bernardo Vieco Ortiz (1886\u20131956), located in the San Pedro Cemetery Museum in the city of Medell\u00edn. The play represents the drama of human pain in the face of the loss of a loved one using the iconographic image of the descent of Christ dead in the arms of Mary.\nThis sculpture was chosen for the analysis for the following characteristics:1.\nThe sculpture is cast in a copper base alloy.\n\u00a02.\nVieco was the first artist to have a bronze casting workshop dedicated to the production of sculptures and decorative objects in Colombia.\n\u00a03.\nThe proximity of the work to the viewer allows one to easily take samples.\n\u00a04.\nThe work is located in the most important cemetery in the city, where the mausoleums of various personages are found, therefore it has been more protected from anthropogenic interventions than the works found in parks and squares. This shows the deterioration generated mainly by environmental factors.\n\u00a05.\nWithin the information collected, no evidence of cleaning or restoration of the work was found from the time of its installation.\n\u00a0\n\n\nSampling\nFirst, a visual observation was made that permitted the finding of the points that presented defects and irregularities in the bronze, some of them can be seen in Fig.\u00a02, as well as the different products of corrosion.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nDamage found on the surface of the sculpture. a Cracks. b Separation between the parts that make up the sculpture\n\n\nFor the purpose of this article it was very important to determine the presence of some chemical elements that are characteristic of non-protective patinas, such as chlorine, as in our case the stability of the patina is related directly with the concept of the poetic image of bronze.\nThe analysis of this type of works is quite difficult since the norms of patrimonial conservation do not allow one to take quantities of material sufficient to make laboratory analyzes with conventional techniques, since this would be to the detriment of the work either by the loss of matter or by the destabilization of existing patinas. There currently exists portable equipment like the X-ray fluorescence spectrometers, which have proved to be very effective for the characterization of the patinas in sculptures and bells [15]. Unfortunately, for the present investigation we could not count with any of this equipment in order to make a characterization in situ, for this reason the samples of the analysis of the corrosion products were taken with a scalpel by grazing and a JEOL JSM-6490LV Scanning Electron Microscope was used to observe the morphology of the corrosion products and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy tests (SEM\u2013EDX) for the chemical composition. The samples were mounted on a carbon tape and gold sputtered with a Hummer 6.2 apparatus at 15\u00a0mA AC for 30\u00a0s to obtain a thin AU film of around 1\u00a0nm.\nThese analyses were complemented with X-ray diffraction (XRD) to properly identify the primary species present. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was done with an X\u2019Pert PRO diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01.5406\u00a0\u00c5), using a 45\u00a0kV voltage and scanning between 10 and 80\u00ba.\nThe sampling points can be seen in Fig.\u00a03 and the sampling methods in Fig.\u00a04.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nSampling point for SEM\u2013EDX analysis. a Sample 1. b Sample 2. c Sample 3\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a04\nMethodology for sampling. a Obtaining metal base shavings taken from the bottom of the sculpture. b Obtaining the corrosion products by mechanical cleaning with a scalpel\n\n\n\nResults\nIn Fig.\u00a05 and Table\u00a01 the results obtained for the chemical composition of the base metal made on the sample obtained from the base of the Christ can be observed. Unfortunately it was not possible to take samples of the base metal of the figure of Mary.

For sample 1, see Fig.\u00a07a, Cuprite (Cu2O) and Tenorite (CuO) phases were identified. Furthermore, the presence of hydrosulfate of hydrated copper (Cu5 (SO4)2(OH)6\u00b75H2O) and of Atacamite phase (Cu2Cl(OH)3) were detected. In sample 2, see Fig.\u00a07b, the presence of Cuprite and Azurite (Cu3(CO3)(OH)2) were observed. In sample 3, see Fig.\u00a07c, Cuprite and Tenorite phases were distinguished.\n\nFig.\u00a07\nX-ray diffraction patterns of sculpture corrosion products, a Samples 1, b Sample 2, c Sample 3\n\n\n\nDiscussionThe chemical analyses, the differences in texture, and differences in color of the patinas of La Piedad indicate that the Christ was apparently cast in a brass, while Mary was cast in bronze. Both figures show high contents of chlorine in their patinas which gives indications of the presence of a non-protective patina. In addition, the work shows black spots on its surface produced by the deposition of organic material and atmospheric pollutants combined with the products of corrosion such as dark green Brochantite, under which Atacamite can appear and which is reported in the XRD in sample 1.Now, in order to appreciate the contribution of the patina to the poetic image of bronze in the sculpture La Piedad, it will be necessary to consider two categories of analysis, the first being the aesthetic value of the patina, which will be linked with the considerations taken into account by the artist to give the final finish to his work.According to the information collected, the original patina of La Piedad was dark brown, possibly formed by copper oxides, of which there are some remains in the sculpture as can be seen in Fig.\u00a08a, in the results of the analyses of sample 3 presented in Table\u00a02 and XRD of all samples. On the other hand, in the model of the work that is in the Antioquia Museum [20] and can be seen in Fig.\u00a08b there is a dark brown patina, homogeneous and with a waxy gloss, as can be seen in Fig.\u00a08c of the Vieco family photographic archive [21].\n\nFig.\u00a08\nOriginal patina of La Piedad. a Residues of the original patina on the front of the right leg of Christ. b Model belonging to the Antioquia Museum. c Bernardo Vieco (bottom right) in the workshop with his assistants and with the finished work\n\nAs can be seen, this patina differs completely from the present one, which affects the perception of the spectator, since although it is clear that the scene represents the psychology of human pain and impotence before the inevitable, it could be said that the darkness of the original patina gave visual weight and gravity to the psychology represented by the work, but giving account of the validity, immutability and durability of this deep and infinite pain, accepted with resignation and hope, which is characteristic of a funerary sculpture framed in The Christian context.On the other hand, the type of deterioration that the work presents at present, evidenced in the chlorine content of the products of corrosion, in the variety of blue and green patina shades, in the black spots, the fissures and the loss of cohesion of the parts that comprise it, not only accentuates this immanent pain, surpassing the limit of the impotence expressed in the face of Mary, but also reaching the hopelessness embodied in a material that dissolves over time, with exposure to aggressive environments and for abandonment to their fate, without human mediation to protect it. Thus, as the poet Rogelio Echavarr\u00eda would say, \u201cBronze is no longer eternal\u201d [22].The second category of analysis is the historical value of the patina, which not only accounts for the aesthetic values proposed by the artist, but also gives the work a life of its own according to the changes in the material that conforms it, contributing with its color, texture and stability to the strengthening or weakening of the expression of the artist. So, as we saw with La Piedad, it could be said that this image of deterioration and abandonment strengthens the image of pain and bereavement of the loss of a loved one.\nConclusionsBronze has physicochemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties that allow the obtaining of detailed and complex forms in different sizes, depth in the low reliefs, ease of reproduction and durability, qualities difficult to find in other materials, reasons why the Greeks preferred marble, achieving works of high technical and aesthetic sophistication, bequeathing this tradition to future generations, heirs of their culture.However, the scarcity of raw materials and metallurgical difficulties mean that the production of a high-quality bronze sculpture requires highly qualified personnel, adequate equipment and raw materials, which are obtained mainly in countries with a grand sculptural tradition such as Italy and France. This makes the production of sculptures at the national level more expensive and makes them a symbol of prestige and power, used mainly for the elaboration of official orders or by sculptors of high economic level, which in turn stimulates the vandalism, theft and melting down of sculptures made in bronze.Although traditionally the copper base alloy used for the production of sculptures has been bronze, the results of the chemical analyzes reported for this work, as well as that reported in other studies of Colombian works, have shown that brass is frequently used [23]. These two families of copper base alloys have large mechanical, metallurgical and physicochemical differences between them, so their behavior in the face of environmental factors is different. In La Piedad two alloys are used, the anodic potentials are quite similar, ranging from 0.35 and 0.45\u00a0V [24]. Although this is a very small difference to generate a strong galvanic corrosion, it is reported that eventually can cause a deterioration in brass, [25].The metallurgical archetype of bronze consists of the images that have arisen in the psyche of people who have interacted in some way with this metal since ancient times and who have more evidence in the interaction with statues, monuments and works of art which, having a patrimonial legacy, enjoy greater protection and attention than objects of daily use.These archetypal images have their roots in the material properties of bronze, the patina with its aesthetic and historical values, which contributes most in the construction of the poetic image of this metal, reinforcing or weakening the expression of the artist in function of its stability or deterioration.In the case of La Piedad, we find that its patina is not stable and protective and that consequently this increases the drama of pain and impotence, taking it to the levels of hopelessness and bereavement characteristic of the death of a loved one, as evidenced in a bronze deteriorated by its iteration with the environment and by neglect in its conservation and protection. Upon the conclusions of this paper, authors are trying to manage with the Museum the restoration works of the sculpture.Finally, it can be said that the chemical analyzes allow a principle of reality for the sustentation of a philosophical and aesthetic position, as well as for the change of cultural paradigms. In the case specifically studied, it can be evidenced that due to the change of a protective patina for a non-protective patina, is detrimental to the perenniality of bronze, that symbolic quality in which the aesthetic and historical value of the patina, so appreciated by sculptors, poets, restorers, historians and the community in general. The work begins to be seriously threatened in contemporary times by high levels of pollution, degrading its material condition, affecting the reading and interpretation of the work, but in turn making possible the construction of new poetic images.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsCS conceived of the presented idea, developed the theory and experimental design.

Oil on canvas, 54.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a073.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.6\u00a0cm. \u00a9Norfolk Museums Service\n\nIt is one of four variants entitled La condition humaine that Magritte painted between 1933 and 1935 (RMCR no. 351, 372 and 387) [1]. It depicts a painting within a painting, a favourite recurring theme used by the artist throughout his oeuvre. In this version Magritte depicts the inside of a cave. There is a fire in the left corner conveying a warm glow to the foreground while the cave provides a view over a distant mountainous landscape. A painted canvas standing on an easel and placed at the opening of the cave, depicts the continuation of this landscape but also contains a castle perched on a precipice.The painting has been in the collection of the Norwich Castle Museum since 1995 when it was accessioned as part of a large bequest of 20th century art known as the Adeane Collection. Robert Adeane acquired the painting in 1966 from the Mayor Gallery in London, and its provenance can be traced back to Basil Wright, London, 1936 [1].In February 2016, the painting underwent a routine examination following the request for loan to the exhibition La trahison des images, at the Pompidou Centre/Paris, (September 2016 to January 2017). At this point conservators noticed that the turnover edges of the canvas extended onto the reverse and were painted with a scheme that did not correspond to the composition on the front (Fig.\u00a02a).\n\nFig.\u00a02\n\na Reverse of La condition humaine (surface composition) \u00a9Norfolk Museums Service, b Ren\u00e9 Magritte, La pose enchant\u00e9e, (The Enchanted Pose, 1927) B/W illustration from the Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 (red dotted line showing area corresponding to the paint found on the turnover edges of La condition humaine)\n\nMagritte had clearly re-used an older canvas to paint this version of La condition humaine.The re-use of earlier unwanted paintings by artists is well known to art specialists. Moreover, there are well documented examples of Magritte himself undertaking such practices.1\nHowever, whilst noting this as an interesting find, a closer inspection of the edges of the painting revealed a much more exciting connection. In this case, the colours exposed seemed to relate to a recently discovered painting by the artist, La pose enchant\u00e9e, dating from 1927, illustrated in the Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 (RMCR no. 163), of which the whereabouts have been unknown since 1932 [2] (Fig.\u00a02).In 2013, a quarter of Magritte\u2019s La pose enchant\u00e9e was discovered below another painting by the artist in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), NY [3]. During preparations for the exhibition \u201cMagritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926\u20131938\u201d, 2014, it became clear that Le Portrait 1935, concealed the top left quarter of the lost composition. Moreover, the same team of conservators and curators led by Michael Duffy was fortunate to discover the bottom left quarter of La pose enchant\u00e9e, when examining Le mod\u00e8le rouge, 1935 (RMCR no. 382, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden), then an incoming loan to the same exhibition. At that point, the left half of the lost composition had been discovered [4]. In the next few paragraphs, we will discuss how in 2016, three years after the initial discovery, the whereabouts of the lower right section of this lost composition became known.\nExperimentalChemical element mapping was performed on the painting using a Macroscopic X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) scanning instrument, built by the University of Antwerp. This device is an advanced version of the \u2018B\u2019 setup described by Alfeld et al. [5]. A measuring head is moved over the paint surface by two X\u2013Y motors (Newport, USA) with a distance of ca 8\u00a0mm between the detector snout and paint surface. The measuring head consists of a 10\u00a0W Rh target X-ray tube (Moxtek, USA) and a SDD detector (Vortex EX90, USA) with an energy resolution of <145\u00a0eV at Mn-K\u03b1. The incident primary beam is at a right angle to the paint surface, while the detector is positioned at a 50\u00b0 angle with respect to the incident beam. The beam size is defined by means of a lead collimator with a pinhole diameter of 0.8\u00a0mm. For the Magritte painting, elemental distribution maps were collected over an area measuring 54.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a073.2\u00a0cm2, with a step size of 750\u00a0\u00b5m and a dwell time of 200\u00a0ms/step; X-ray tube settings were 45\u00a0kV and 200\u00a0\u00b5A. The ensuing data cube was processed with in-house developed Datamuncher software [6] and the X-ray spectrometry software packages PyMcA [7] and bAxil [8].The result of the scanning and fitting operation are two dimensional distribution images, one for each fitted elemental line. In these images a brighter pixel means a higher fitted XRF intensity in that pixel. Despite the fact that X-rays possess more penetrative power than most other types of radiation used for imaging purposes, these are prone to absorption phenomena as well. Especially the lower energetic XRF signals (which are at the border with the extreme UV-band), are more sensitive to absorption effects.Also the layer build-up has an influence on the distribution images, as heavier elements absorb XRF radiation better than lighter elements. As a result, it is possible to see heavier elements, overpainted by lighter elements, whereas it is not possible to see lighter elements overpainted by heavier elements (e.g. lead). A clear example is the column of the original composition: the bright areas, where lead white was applied to create highlights, the XRF-signals from the underlying Zn-layer are absorbed to a greater extent than those originating from under the shadow regions (which are painted using pigments consisting of lighter elements).\nResults and discussionAs mentioned earlier, La condition humaine 1935, is painted over a quarter of La pose enchant\u00e9e 1927, in a similar way to Le portrait and Le mod\u00e8le rouge. Together with a matching date of 1935 and close dimensions to the latter paintings, La condition humaine exposed enough colour and compositional features on its edges to positively link it to the missing painting as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.It was possible at this stage to visually relate the exposed paint to elements from the missing composition La pose enchant\u00e9e and determine which part was actually concealed under the current painting.The painting was subsequently examined with X-ray radiography (XRR) which confirmed this finding (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nFig.\u00a03\nX-ray radiograph of La condition humaine. \u00a9Hamilton Kerr Institute\n\nWhen rotated 180\u00b0, the lower torso, the hand and the legs of the standing figure can be easily distinguished in the XRR image. A direct correlation with the lower right quarter of La pose enchant\u00e9e can be made, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04. Other features such as part of the column and the shadow that the figure casts on the foreground and wall can also be seen in the rotated X-ray radiograph. The previously discovered quarters of the painting were rotated over 90\u00b0 before repainting.\n\nFig.\u00a04\n\na\nLa pose enchant\u00e9e\n\u2014detail of lower right quarter. b X-ray radiograph of La condition humaine rotated 180\u00b0 \u00a9Hamilton Kerr Institute. The features of the underlying painting are highlighted in red\n\n\nFollowing from the studies and research already carried out on Le portrait and Le mod\u00e8le rouge, the painting underwent further examinations with MA-XRF analytical and imaging techniques, employed to collect a set of elemental distribution maps of the painting. The ensuing series of maps provided confirmation and further information on the palette and techniques used by Magritte whilst painting La pose enchant\u00e9e and La condition humaine.\n\nThe hidden painting: La pose enchant\u00e9e\n\nThe series of elemental maps resulting from a full MA-XRF scan of the painting can be seen in Fig.\u00a05.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nNormal light image, X-ray radiograph (XRR) and MA-XRF elemental distribution maps detected in La condition humaine; white equals high intensity, black low intensity\n\n\nDistinct features from the underlying La pose enchant\u00e9e as well as compositional elements from the upper painting, are revealed in both the lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) maps. This indicates the presence of both of these elements in both compositions and concurs with the proposed layer build-up of Le portrait, that the earliest composition was painted on top of a double preparation with a thin lead-based priming over a zinc based ground layer [9]. In fact, the zinc distribution map shows an emphasized canvas weave pattern, corroborating that a pigment rich in this element was applied directly to the canvas. As in the case of the Le Portrait, the zinc maps appear as a negative image of the lead distribution, an indication that the Zn signal is blocked locally by the application on top of it of lead rich paint used as a priming and in the modelling of the nude figure of the hidden painting. The fact that the distribution maps of these two elements is complementary is an indication that these elements are present in distinct layers, one on top of another. Furthermore, measurements of the XRF signal taken from the verso side of the canvas show an increase in the intensity of the signal for these two elements, and in addition the zinc is detected relatively more compared to lead, supporting the assumption that the ground build-up is similar to previous cases where sampling was performed; A zinc (Zn) containing ground (where also calcium\u2014Ca is present), covered by a thinner lead (Pb)\u2014rich ground.\nChromium (Cr) is the only other element that shows some form of detail from the underlying composition. There is a positive signal in the area corresponding to the fraction of sky paint between the arm of the standing figure and the wall, and this can be seen at the centre along the lower edge. The other detected elements are associated with the upper painting, La condition humaine.\nThe underlying composition clearly visible in the zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) distribution maps is not easily visible in the distributions for other elements present such as calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe). The explanation for this is that the Zn-rich ground-layer being much thicker than the actual paint layer of this composition means that the primary X-rays \u2018meet\u2019 Zn-atoms over a longer path length, resulting in a larger number of Zn atoms emitting their XRF signals. Also, Zn has a higher atomic number and thus results in more energetic XRF-signals, that are subsequently lesser absorbed when compared to the calcium or the iron signals.\n\nThe surface painting: La condition humaine\n\nThe main individual forms of the surface painting such as the cave, the mountains, the fire, the easel and the canvas, can be easily identified in the elemental distribution images. These features are revealed differently in each of the maps reflecting their specific chemical composition as a direct result of the artist\u2019s choice of pigments and paint application sequence. As such, a careful study of the elemental maps allows one to deduce information on the composition and build-up of the painted image.\n\nInitial layout of the composition\nThe iron (Fe) distribution map shows that Magritte used iron rich pigments to establish the initial general form of the cave. Umbers, ochres and siennas all contain different forms of iron oxide [10, 11]. In addition, the distribution of manganese (Mn), although a weaker signal, is very similar to that of iron (Fe) in many areas. This co-location of the two elements suggests the presence of umber (Fe and Mn oxides), which occurs in a variety of mid-brown shades.\nThe lead (Pb) distribution map also shows clearly an initial laying out of the opening of the cave done in a lead-rich paint, probably lead white. This is likely to have been executed in tandem with the first design of the cave walls described here. These observations (as well as the absence of any evidence around the edges of the canvas of an intermediate paint layer) contribute to the deduction that Magritte painted directly onto the underlying composition, without applying an intermediate preparation layer. These initial broad volumes in earth pigments and lead white would have facilitated the painting process significantly by blocking out the underlying composition.\nThe cave opening displays a fuzzy and irregular edge visible in the XRR image and in the lead distribution map. This is the result of a quick and rough laying out of this initial lead-based form. The edges were later sharpened up by precise application of a fine line of the same mid-brown paint used for the cave, and the pale blue used for the sky. This corrective contour containing iron (Fe) and also to some extent calcium (Ca) and cobalt (Co), appears in the lead (Pb) map as a fine dark outline. This line in negative corresponds to the presence of iron, calcium and cobalt at the surface of the painting, thus masking the lead emission signal coming from the underlying thin lead white layer. These same outlines are visible in the distribution maps for these elements (Fe, Co, Ca) as highlights.\n\n\nBuild-up of composition and detail\nOnce the layout of the cave with its opening onto a landscape was set, Magritte would have concentrated on giving these areas some extra form and detail. The modelling in the browns of the cave wall seems to be obtained by a mixture of iron, cobalt and calcium. The source of calcium is difficult to pinpoint as it can be due to a number of materials. However the calcium (Ca) signal seems to intensify in the darker shades. As with other known cases (Van der Snickt et al. [9]) Magritte seems to have used bone black [12], both in pure form but also mixed with umber to achieve most of the modelling of the darker browns.\nApart from in the walls of the cave, cobalt (Co) is also present in the blueish mountains paint. The fact that the cobalt signal in the mountains coincides with that of tin (Sn) implies that Magritte used cerulean blue (CoSnO3) for the rendering of the mountains and the castle in the distant blueish landscape. The highlights and shadows of the mountain face would have been modelled at this stage.\nThe sky area displays a noisy signal in the cobalt distribution map, making it difficult to determine if this element is present here. The very light blue tone is painted with a lead white paint to which a small amount of blue pigment was added. Consequently, cobalt might very well be present in a concentration below the detection limit of the MA-XRF instrument, especially when considering the relative low atomic number of this element. However, when examining the data directly (rather that the resulting distributions), the presence of both cobalt and tin are detected at much lower intensities.\nInterestingly, there is also a significant presence of cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) in the modelling of the cave walls and also of chromium (Cr) but to a lesser extent. The latter element displays a similar distribution to cobalt. Areas rich in cobalt and chromium seems to correspond to areas where the mid/dark browns exhibit a noticeable greenish tint. Iron (Fe), although present mostly due to use of umbers, is also significantly present in these greenish tinted areas, and so it is possible that Magritte used not only umbers and black to model the cave, but also other green and/or blue pigments containing Cr, Co, Sn and Fe.\nThe use of chromium oxide green and/or viridian (hydrated chromium oxide) would account for the presence of chromium (Cr). Newman [13] mentions these two types of chromium oxide green, their appearance varying from \u201ca dull opaque olive green to an intense, transparent, somewhat bluish green\u201d. There is evidence of a green paint smeared around the edges and onto the reverse of the canvas, including a finger print which we can only assume to be from Magritte\u2019s hand (Fig.\u00a06).\n\nFig.\u00a06\nDetails from the reverse of La condition humaine (Fig.\u00a02a): showing olive green paint on the left edge of canvas and a fingerprint in a more translucent green paint on the right edge of the canvas again over the underlying composition. The black inscription is also almost certainly painted by Magritte\n\n\nThis paint varies from a dull opaque green tone as seen on the left edge of the canvas to a more vibrant hue as seen on the finger print to the right edge, suggesting that Magritte was using different greens simultaneously and possibly both types of the chromium oxide.\nAlternatively the artist might have resorted to a rarer pigment called \u2018blue-green chrome\u2019. This pigment with an approximate formula of Cr2O3\u00b7CoO\u00b7Al2O3, also mentioned by Newman [13] and Wehlte [14] appears to be made from a fusion of chromium, cobalt and aluminium oxides, and this would explain the presence of Cr and Co. An alternative and perhaps a more likely explanation for the co-location of both cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) could be the use of cerulean blue, then mixed with yellows such as cobalt yellow or an iron (Fe) oxide yellow, and also with chromium (Cr) oxide to achieve a green/blueish colour.\nThe green paint seen in Fig.\u00a06 is likely to relate to the green used by the artist to modify the browns of the cave, but further analysis with a species-selective analytical technique is needed to enable a full identification of the pigments present (e.g. in situ Raman, FTIR, XRD).\n\n\nThe easel, the canvas, the castle and the fire\nIt was only after the modelling of the cave and landscape with its mountains and sky that Magritte began to add the remaining compositional features to the painting. These compositional elements appear to have been added directly without the use of reserves, as illustrated below.\nThe iron (Fe) map shows clearly that the easel was painted on top of the brown foreground. The composition shows the easel painted in front of and over the foreground. When comparing the painting with the iron distribution map, we can see that the foreground is continuous behind the shapes of the easel legs.\nSimilarly, when looking at the cobalt (Co) map, we can see that the wooden legs of the easel extend over the blue paint of the mountain. The contours of the depicted canvas, painted with a grey mixture of lead white and bone black, mask the cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) emissions, showing that these were also painted on top of the mountain blue.\nThe calcium (Ca) distribution map indicates this element to be abundant in the black paint passages. Here the use of bone black appears in the painting of the fine details of the easel such as the fixings, the nails and the small shadows of the tripod. Calcium can also be detected on all the small tacks along the canvas edge, although here with a much fainter signal.\nThe castle, presenting a similar elemental distribution of Co and Sn and with highlights rich in lead (Pb) as the mountains, was also painted in the same blue (likely cerulean blue) and added after the painting of the sky.\nThe red/orange fire with its flames and reflections was painted with a large range of different pigments [10]. A mercury (Hg) rich paint, probably vermillion, was used specifically in this area and, apart from a faint thin application to the foreground where the artist thought to convey a warmer tone to the entrance of the cave, it is absent from everywhere else in the composition. It appears to have been applied thinly at first, setting out the position and triangular shape of the warm glow, and probably over the first layer of umber, as the Hg rich paint seems to shield the iron signal from below (Fig.\u00a05).\nMagritte seems to have then progressed by setting out the form of the fire. A pale and cool grey colour containing lead (Pb) was used to establish the centre and the position of the fire in the foreground. At the base of the fire, black (Ca) and dark brown paint (Fe) were used to draw the dark wood/charcoal from which the flames emerges. There is also a pale, opaque yellow layer containing cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn), present at the centre and below the intense orange and red fiery flames. This is likely to consist of Cadmium Zinc Sulphide, a yellow/orange pigment [15, 16]. The deeper red and orange flames were painted with a mixture containing Hg, Cr and Pb. The presence of both lead and chromium suggests that a combination of vermillion with chrome yellow was employed to obtain the yellow colour. The varying intensity of the emission signal for mercury (Hg) shows that it was also used in a mixture.\nIt is possible to also discern a few individual flame details painted with a mid-tone orange, that show specifically both lead (Pb)and chromium (Cr) signals, suggesting the use of chrome orange. Finally there are a few last touches containing iron, likely to have been painted with an iron oxide red (Fe).\n\n\n\nLa pose enchant\u00e9e: MA-XRF on the turnover edge\nElemental imaging (see Fig.\u00a07) was also performed on the turnover edge where the paint of La pose enchant\u00e9e is exposed, revealing a section of the sky and the wall from this hidden composition (Fig.\u00a07).\n\nFig.\u00a07\nElemental distribution maps and detail from the reverse of La condition humaine showing the turnover edge with the exposed underlying composition and also the approximate location of the scanned area outlined in red\n\n\n\nThe results confirm previous findings and concur with the already established layer build-up (Van der Snickt et al. [9]). The zinc rich ground is covered by a thin priming most probably lead white. The blue sky area is characterized by a strong chromium signal while no other metallic elements such as Co, Cu, Fe or Sn were detected. This is consistent with the previous proposal that the sky was painted using a blue possibly containing chromium oxide. According to the literature [17], Magritte and others were known to use available and ready mixed blue paints, containing anhydrous chromium (III) oxides to alter the hue of blue pigments. Further analysis as well as sampling from this area would need to be carried out to enable a positive identification of the blue pigment used with a possible addition of a chromium oxide compound, for the rendering of the sky.\nLead white (Pb) was used to model the flesh tones in combination with earth pigments containing iron (Fe) and bone black. Calcium (Ca) was found particularly in the dark shadows of the flesh tones indicating the use of bone black. The latter was mixed with the warmer earth pigments to achieve the modelling of the standing figure.\nIn addition, calcium is also found in the shadow that the figure casts on the wall, but no iron is present here. This is a confirmation of what is already visible with the naked eye on this strip of paint, and which makes the most significant addition to our current knowledge of the palette of the underlying painting\u2014that the wall is painted with a simple mixture of lead white and bone black, and is of a cool grey colour. This finding will contribute to the updating of an already proposed colour reconstruction image of Magritte\u2019s La pose enchant\u00e9e [4, 18].\n\nConclusionThe elemental identification and mapping of La condition humaine 1935, also containing a section of La pose enchant\u00e9e, 1927, provided us with further information regarding Magritte\u2019s palette during these two distinct periods in his life, at the same time as contributing to a better understanding of the artist\u2019s painting technique. His precise paint handling and attention to detail is also demonstrated to be at times intricate and complex as shown for example by the use of a great variety of pigments on a single compositional feature.This analytical study is a testimony to Magritte\u2019s meticulous paint application, resulting in his typical highly defined compositions with contrasting and identifiable elements; this style of painting typical of the artist\u2019s oeuvre not compromised at all, even during what must have been in 1935, a very busy and prolific period in his career.\nFootnotes1Examples include:The Song of the Storm, 1938, RMCR no. 448 painted over an earlier portrait.The Secret Landscape, 1935, RMCR no. 367, painted over part of an earlier composition entitled The Unknown Role, 1928.Time Transfixed, 1938, painted over an abandoned composition entitled Spring Eternal, for which there are two study drawings dating from 1937\u201338.

De HeemStill life paintingMacroscopic X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imagingLight microscopyPaint cross-sectionTechnical historical sources\nIntroductionAnalytical imaging techniques are of great value for the investigation of old master paintings. Currently, macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) scanning is one of the most important methods for visualizing the elemental distribution of a painting in a non-invasive way. With separate comprehensive elemental distribution images from the entire paint surface, the technique makes it possible to characterize a painting\u2019s surface and subsurface layers, which may include grounds, underdrawing, underpainting, compositional changes (pentimenti) and even abandoned compositions [1\u20134]. This offers an insight into a painting\u2019s creation process and the modus operandi of artists. Moreover, since its development, the technique contributed to elucidate art historical, art theoretical and conservation related questions [5]. In spite of its benefits, the technique has limitations as well. The most important drawback of MA-XRF scanning is the fact that the technique is not depth selective, with elemental images that can show contributions from different levels in the stratigraphy [6]. MA-XRF on its own does not reveal the exact number of strata and it is not always clear from which layer the detected signals are stemming. In addition, there is a variable degree of attenuation of the signal, depending on the thickness, atomic number and density of superimposed materials, that has to be taken into account while interpreting the chemical maps.To address this limitation and furthermore to assess the extent to which MA-XRF scanning can characterize a multi-layered painting technique, MA-XRF experiments on five still life paintings of Jan Davidsz. de Heem (1606\u20131684) were complemented with cross-section examinations and technical historical sources. Jan Davidsz de Heem is known for his elaborate finely detailed and meticulously composed still life paintings and considered as \u2018one of the most notorious flower- and fruit painters\u2019 [7]. The case studies are five flower and fruit still life paintings, dated in De Heem\u2019s middle-late period between the 1650s and 1684, with similar subject matters, from the collection of the Rijksmuseum, the Mauritshuis and the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a01, the case studies include four paintings on canvas and one smaller painting on a copperplate. While Meijer recently published a monography on De Heem\u2019s oeuvre, technical aspects of his work were published by Wallert [8].\n\nFig.\u00a01\nTimeline with the indication of De Heem\u2019s career and the works discussed in this paper: a \u2018Garland of Fruit and Flowers\u2019, Probably 1650\u20131660, 60.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a074.7\u00a0cm, Mauritshuis, inv. no. 49, oil on canvas \u00a9Mauritshuis; b \u2018Festoon of Fruits and Flowers\u2019, 1660\u20131670, 73.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a059.6\u00a0cm, Rijksmuseum, inv. no.

Cross-section microscopy has proven to be highly complementary with MA-XRF, combining the overall compositional information of a painting with local, but layer specific analysis of a paint system on the microscale [5]. Subsequent analysis of the paint cross-sections by means of a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (SEM\u2013EDX) spectrometer provides more information about how chemical elements are distributed over the various layers and enables a better detection for lower Z elements, for which MA-XRF is less sensitive [5].Finally, a multi-disciplinary approach was employed by comparing the results from MA-XRF scanning and cross-section analysis with advised recipes, as well as materials and techniques written in seventeenth century artist\u2019s manuscripts. The study of seventeenth century flower and fruit still life paintings is ideal for this type of research for several reasons. The practice was determined by common stylistic rules, techniques, and recipes [9]. A specific multi-layered build-up for each subject is in fact characteristic of this genre, where the technical challenge for painters was to achieve and imitate the perfect surface textures and the accurate appearance of objects such as the soft and delicate petals of pink roses, the velvet skin of plums, peaches and apricots, dewdrops on Spanish grapes, or the reflected glow on golden goblets. An elaborate working process that required a precise touch, a systematic approach, and the use of proper painterly effects from the ground up to the uppermost paint layers for each depicted object. Fortunately, the seventeenth century instilled a great enthusiasm for publications on technical matters, including the materials and techniques for still life painting. Various technical sources contain recipes for the preparation of paints, with characteristics, their compatibility with other pigments, their working qualities, their ageing properties, and techniques for refining [10, 11]. Other technical sources comment on the proper way to arrange the composition, sometimes giving detailed descriptions on how to paint specific types of objects [10, 12]. This provides a wide range of information for technical examination of relevant works.\nMethods\nMacro X-ray fluorescence imaging\nFor organizational reasons, two different instruments were used. Elemental mapping of the entire surface and details of the paintings from the collection of the Rijksmuseum, Still Life with Flowers in a Glass Vase and Festoon of Fruit and Flowers were performed with the commercially available MA-XRF scanner M6 Jetstream from Bruker Nano GmbH (Berlin, Germany). The M6 Jetstream consists of a 30\u00a0W Rh-target microfocus X-ray tube with a maximum voltage of 50\u00a0kV, a maximum current of 0.6\u00a0mA, a polycapillary lens, and a 30\u00a0mm2 X-Flash silicon drift detector that is moved over the surface of the painting by means of an X, Y-motorized stage, enabling a scan area of 80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060\u00a0cm2 [13]. A spot size of 150\u00a0\u00b5m was set for the measurements. The elemental distribution maps of the painting Festoon of Fruit and Flowers were collected with a step size of 600\u00a0\u03bcm and dwell time of 50\u00a0ms/step, covering the complete surface (1232\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0963 pixels), and a step size of 400\u00a0\u03bcm and 250\u00a0ms/step for a detailed area (478\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0552 pixels). The full surface of the painting Still Life with Flowers in a Glass Vase (1072\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0704 pixels) was scanned with a step size of 500\u00a0\u03bcm and a dwell time of 100\u00a0ms/step. In addition, two detailed scans were made, one in the center of the painting (532\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0498 pixels), scanned with step size 500\u00a0\u00b5m and dwell time 200\u00a0ms/step; and one of a detail of the yellow Persian roses (275\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0283 pixels) with step size 300\u00a0\u00b5m and dwell time 200\u00a0ms/step.\nThe still-life paintings Garland of Fruit and Flowers and Vase of Flowers from the Mauritshuis museum and Flowers and Insects from the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp were measured by means of the AXIL scanner, an in-house built mobile MA-XRF scanner (AXES, University of Antwerp, Belgium). The AXIL scanner consists of a 50\u00a0W Molybdenum anode microfocus X-ray tube (XOS X-beam powerflux) equipped with a fixed polycapillary lens and a Silicon Drift Diode (SDD) detector, mounted on a motorized stage. This scanner allows for the investigation of an area of 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a057\u00a0cm2 in a single scan. The X-ray source was operated at 50\u00a0kV voltage and 1\u00a0mA current, collecting full surface maps with step size 650\u00a0\u00b5m and dwell time 285\u00a0ms/step for Garland of Fruit and Flowers and Flowers and Insects and step size 600\u00a0\u00b5m and dwell time 275\u00a0ms/step for Vase of Flowers.\nAll XRF spectral fitting were processed using the data analysis software packages PyMca (Python multichannel analyzer) and Datamuncher Beta 1.2.2 [14, 15].\n\nCross-section microscopy\nThe available paint cross-sections were re-examined and photographed according to the protocol of the Paint Sample Database (PSD) in the atelier building of the Rijksmuseum. For imaging the paint cross-sections in visible light, Bright Field (BF) and Dark Field (DF) mode, and Ultraviolet radiation (UV365\u00a0nm), the light microscope Zeiss AXIO Imager.A2m (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, United States) was used. Images were recorded with an Axio Cam MRc5 mounted camera, producing 5 megapixels 12-bit images. White light was provided by a LED lamp with a color temperature of 5600 Kelvin and a colibri.2 controller for UV-fluorescence microscopy (LED 365\u00a0nm). All images were obtained and processed in the image-acquisition software Zen 2 pro (blue edition) with extended depth of focus (MEDF) facilities and observed on a calibrated Eizo Color Edge CG277 BK computer screen. All microscopic images were color calibrated with the Rijksmuseum CZI conversion utility tool, created by Robert Erdmann. Scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM\u2013EDX) studies were performed on a JEOL JSM 5910 LV scanning electron microscope with Noran Vantage EDX system (spot analysis and elemental mapping facilities) at the Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE) in Amsterdam. For the analysis of high-resolution SE and BSE images in high vacuum, samples were gold-coated in a JEOL JFC 1200 fine coater prior to analysis to improve surface conductivity. EDX spot analysis of the pigment particles was done at 20\u00a0kV acceleration voltage, 5\u201310\u00a0mm eucentric working distance in high vacuum.\n\nTechnical sources\nThe significance of the analyses was substantiated with three historical technical sources on the oil painting of still lifes. In this framework, the most relevant source with detailed instructions for the pictorial construction of objects with different surface textures is the painter\u2019s handbook \u2018De groote waereld in t kleen geschildert\u2019, i.e. \u2018The big world\u2026\u2019 (1692), published in Amsterdam by Willem Beurs [13]. A second manual, \u2018Het Groot schilderboeck\u2019, i.e. Great book of painting (1707) by Gerard de Lairesse, provided key information on the arrangement and composition [12]. Finally, the manuscript Secrets in the Noble Arts of Miniatura or Limning, by minor artist Daniel King (1653\u20131657) contains important original information on oil painting techniques and technical instructions, including recipes from Jan Davidsz de Heem, referred to as \u2018Mr. deHeem\u2019 [16]. This book is, in fact, an appended copy of the work of Edward Norgate\u2019s Miniatura or the Art of Limning, from ca. 1646 [17].\n\nResultsDe Heem\u2019s painting technique is discussed in this section based on examination of the five still lifes under the optical microscope, elemental distribution maps and paint cross-sections linked with technical sources. First, the overall build-up of the paintings is discussed, followed by an in-depth study of the layer system of three details from two paintings: the foliage, a tulip, and an orange, three themes that are considered to be illustrative for De Heem\u2019s refined painting practice.\nPainting technique\nThe layered structure encountered in the five still lifes demonstrates a number of similarities as will be discussed in the next paragraph. This systematic approach can even be noticed in the priming of the canvas paintings. However, characterizing ground layers with MA-XRF scanning is challenging as the emitted fluorescence signal from priming materials is usually significantly attenuated by the superimposed layers. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, the Pb\u2013L maps of all five canvas paintings show a relatively uniform lead distribution over the entire surface, with the depicted subjects in negative. The latter indicates that the detected lead signal is mostly stemming from below these subjects as the fluorescence is (partly) absorbed by their superimposed paint layers. Moreover, the fact that the structure of the canvas weave is visible in the Pb\u2013L map suggests that this uniform lead white-based layer is filling the interstices of the canvas and thus in direct contact with, or at least close to, the canvas (see Fig.\u00a04, Pb\u2013L map).\n\nFig.\u00a02\nOverview of the five studied still life paintings with the corresponding elemental maps for Pb\u2013L, showing a uniform lead distribution for the entire paint surface, Cu\u2013K: copper pigment in the foliage, Hg\u2013L: signal of mercury for the red flowers and fruits and Fe\u2013K: iron pigments present in the ground, underpainting for yellow flowers and in final paint layers for several objects\n\n\nWhen looking closely at the borders of the painting, it becomes clear that the ground contains iron (Fe\u2013K), calcium (Ca\u2013K) and manganese (Mn\u2013K) as well, as the detected signals are stronger in areas where the paint is abraded due to handling or friction with the frame. These damages provide direct access to the preparation as the emitted signals are not attenuated by the overlying paint, as illustrated by Fig.\u00a03.\n\nFig.\u00a03\n\nFestoon of Fruit and Flowers. a The top edge of the painting, b shows stronger signals for iron (Fe\u2013K), calcium (Ca\u2013K) and manganese (Mn\u2013K)\n\n\nThis hypothesis was confirmed by means of microscopic examinations of paint samples. The cross-sections supplied additional information establishing that the works on canvas were all prepared with a double ground. The first is a thin reddish brown ground composed of mainly fine-grained earth pigments, a few particles of umber and chalk, as demonstrated by EDX spot analysis. A thicker grayish brown layer follows, containing a mixture of primarily lead white with fewer particles of umber, red earth pigments and chalk.\nThe painting on copper is somewhat deviant as the cross-section presents a single preparation layer with mainly lead white, charcoal black and earth pigments. This support requires a different handling as compared to the preparation of canvas, but the identified materials conform to recipes described in art technical sources [18, 19]. The different ground is clearly reflected in the MA-XRF Pb\u2013L map shown in Fig.\u00a02, as well as the uniform copper distribution over the entire surface, stemming from the copper substrate.\nOn top of the aforementioned double ground, De Heem first indicated the position of the most prominent fruits, flowers and foliage with an underpainting, also referred to in the literature as lay-in [20, 21] or dead-coloring/doodverf [17]. The underpainting is a key phase in the creation process of a painting defining place and harmony in relation to the surrounding objects. XRF mapping exposes this initial phase, now covered by superimposed paint layers and reveals a carefully planned arrangement. As illustrated by Fig.\u00a02, MA-XRF scans expose abstract, oval-shaped underpaintings for flowers. These underlying layers are visible in Fig.\u00a02 in the Hg-map for the red flowers, in the Fe-map for yellow flowers and in the Pb-map for the white flowers. These egg-shaped forms were applied bigger than the final result, and were narrowed down in a later stage (see further). The underpainting for the fruits is less pronounced than the flowers, as De Heem already follows the shape of the fruit better in this initial phase. Interestingly, De Heem always marked the red flowers in the foreground, with a vermilion underpainting, a red lake was used for the background flowers and a mixture of both for the flowers in between. In this way, the color of the underpainting, that most of the time contributes to the final appearance, determines the object\u2019s distance in space. Strong and bright colored flowers tend to catch the eye, bringing the object to the foreground, while darker colors push the object to the background. In the case of the two garland paintings, De Heem also defined the shape of the guirlande before applying the characteristic big oval shapes for the flowers, as illustrated by the corresponding Cu-map in Fig.\u00a02.\nA similar build-up is described by the Dutch golden age painter and art theorist Gerard de Lairesse: \u2018To paint a festoon, one shall first assign its course and determine how thick or thin it has to be: subsequently the greenery is added, painting the leaves and the foliage, rendering the day side and the shadows according to the light. When dry, one shall arrange the flowers, beginning with the most important, each on their assigned position, and laid-in with a single color, red, blue or yellow, with such a hue that it is proficient to render the day side and shadows from life or from models.\u2019 [12]. For the other three paintings, the underpainting closely follows the outlines of the final greenery and was applied after the position of the most prominent fruits and flowers were indicated. Cross-section and microscopic examinations substantiate these findings. Subsequently, De Heem proceeded from this preliminary composition and worked up the individual depicted flowers, fruits, and other objects in a complicated stratigraphy of paint layers and glazes conforming to the appropriate lighting conditions, ultimately obtaining a balanced depiction of light and shadow. Here, De Heem made use of a systematic approach where each fruit or flower is painted with a specific and identical layer build-up and pigment choice. This was observed by studying the build-up of reoccurring fruits and flowers in the five still life paintings. The main signals observed for the foliage are Cu (copper based green/blue pigment), Ca (yellow lake substrate) and Pb, Sn (lead\u2013tin yellow) for the garland paintings and an addition of Ni, Co, K signals, elements associated with smalt, a blue cobalt potash glass pigment [22], for the other paintings\u00a0(see Additional file 1). Examinations under the stereomicroscope learn that the dark background paint mostly overlaps the outlines of subjects. This finding establishes that the background was applied in the final stage of the painting process, around the main composition. To finish the painting, smaller fruits, little insects and wheat stalks were then painted on the dark background. In the next few paragraphs, we discuss the build-up of these compositional elements in more detail.\n\nCase study: The green foliage in Festoon of Fruits and Flowers\n\nA remarkable aspect of the flower and fruit paintings of Jan Davidsz. de Heem is the beautifully preserved powerful green of the foliage. For seventeenth century still life paintings this is not obvious, as green tones were subject to discoloration. Especially the use of fugitive yellow lake pigments such as Pinke, known in Dutch literature as Schietgeel, in mixtures with blue pigments was responsible for the discoloration of green hues in many paintings [23]. King\u2019s manuscript includes a recipe from Jan Davidsz. de Heem for painting shadows on the foliage and darker leaves. He recommends to paint them with terra verde [referring to green verditer, not to be confused with green earth or terre verte [24], smalt, and sometimes to also incorporate brown and red pigments [16].\nFigure\u00a04d presents the high-resolution chemical maps recorded on a foliage detail of Festoon of Fruits and Flowers. The overall foliage of the festoon and shape of the leaves is defined in the chemical maps for Cu, Ca, Co, Ni, K, Sn, Fe and Pb. Copper is richly present in the green areas of the foliage. A previous study on the cross-section of the painting by Wallert revealed the use of an artificially precipitated copper pigment, which was interpreted at the time as green verditer based on its spherical particle shape and color, mixed with the blue pigment smalt and a yellow lake [17]. However, the color of verditer should be interpreted carefully as a later study by van Loon points out the difficulty in distinguishing the exact color of blue and green verditer under the light microscope [25]. The brown/yellow matrix in which the particles are embedded can obscure the perception, and in addition the particles can vary in color due to the manufacturing process [26]. Interestingly, subsequent MA-XRPD scanning experiments performed directly on the painting (results will be published separately) visualized the distribution of azurite throughout the leaf area. This finding can point towards the use of either natural occurring azurite or its synthetic equivalent \u2018blue verditer\u2019 as both copper carbonates (2CuCO3Cu(OH)2) possess a similar crystal structure. Blue verditer can only be distinguished from azurite by its spherical particle shape. So the copper pigment is likely blue verditer, and not green verditer (which has the same chemical composition as malachite) [24]. The calcium distribution map closely correlates with the copper map in the foliage areas. Chemical maps for calcium are often difficult to interpret because the element is present in various painting materials, like chalk, gypsum, bone white or bone black. The presence of calcium detected in the foliage may be a residue of chalk that was used in excess during the manufacturing process of the copper pigment green verditer [27, 28]. However, the signal of Ca is also abundant in richly dark yellow glazed shadows, and therefore it is more likely present as a substrate of a yellow lake, mixed with the blue verditer. Norgate acknowledges its value in mixtures when he suggests that with \u2018pink [and]\u2026 verditer you are to make the fairest greenes,..\u2019 [27]. A note on shadowing is found in a recipe of \u2018Mr. deHeem\u2019 in King\u2019s manuscript for shadowing objects. De Heem advises not to use umber or black pigments in the shadows of fruits and flowers, but instead to use yellow and red lakes [16]. The cobalt and nickel maps are found to be correlated, indicating the presence of smalt [29]. Nickel is associated with the cobalt ore. Historical descriptions of the production of smalt mention that the cobalt ore was roasted for purification in order to remove contaminants such as arsenic [22]. For pigment production, this step could be intentionally skipped, using the arsenic as an opacifier, making the smalt particles less transparent and the colour more intense [24, 30]. However, the As-map of the painting demonstrates the presence of this element only in the citron and orange where orpiment and/or realgar were used and not in the cobalt areas in the foliage. Presumably, De Heem deliberately used roasted ore with a higher transparency to take advantage of the glazing properties of smalt. The function of the smalt is here not to create a bluer shade but to darken the tone in this shadow area of the leaf. This confirmed a theory already suggested by Wallert for another painting of De Heem [31].\n\nFig.\u00a04\n\nFestoon of Fruits and Flowers. a The painting with a white rectangle indicating the area of a detail scan shown in d. b Detail of the painting, the white arrow indicates the location of the sample shown in c. c Light microscopic image (\u00d7500 magnification, dark field) of a cross-section taken from a shadowed part of a leaf. d Detailed elemental distribution images of the sampled leaf cropped from a larger detail scan acquired with the Bruker M6 Jetstream, scanning 478\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0552 pixels with stepsize 400\u00a0\u00b5m and dwell time/pixel 250\u00a0ms\n\n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a04c, a sample was extracted from this shaded part of a leaf. Apart from evidencing the observations from the MA-XRF scans, the cross-section revealed a build-up of five layers, indicated with numbers 1-5 in Fig.\u00a04c. The first two layers (Fig.\u00a04c 1\u20132) comprise the double ground discussed in the previous section. A green colored underpainting is visible as layer 3 containing blue verditer, yellow lake and smalt. A lighter green was superimposed for modelling texture and veins with lead white, blue verditer and yellow lake (layer 4). The final dark paint layer (layer 5 in Fig.\u00a04c) is the shadow on the leaf and contains blue verditer, smalt and red lake.\n\n\nCase study: The deep red tulip in Flowers and Insects\n\nOne of the studied paintings is a garland, Flowers and Insects, from the collection of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The still life is a well-preserved oil painting on canvas and dated between 1660 and 1670. Characteristic of this period is the depiction of iris and tulip species that are painted half open with slightly twisted petals [32]. Conform to all paintings in this study is De Heem\u2019s abstract, oval, or even egg-shaped underpaintings to paint flowers.\nIn Fig.\u00a05, a selected number of XRF distribution maps are shown to demonstrate the build-up of the prominent white and purple striped tulip in the lower right corner. The maps for Pb, Ca, Fe, Mn, Hg, K and Sn are details taken from a larger scan. As for all canvas paintings under study, lead is present as a constituent of the second ground layer, with the Pb\u2013L signal reproducing the weave pattern of the canvas. However, in the region of the tulip, the Pb-map also shows a clear round-shaped underpainting that clearly exceeds the final outlines of the flower. This shape is present as a negative image in the Fe, Mn and Ca maps as well, because it was applied on top of the double ground. As such, the oval underpainting shields the signals of the elements in the ground layers. A cross-section, taken from a white stripe of one of the purple petals, confirms the presence of an underpainting on top of the double ground composed of lead white, red lake, and some vibrant red particles, most likely vermilion (Fig.\u00a05b, c, layer 3). The subsequent layers also contain tin (Sn-map) and red lake, which has a pink fluorescence under UV [33]. Lake pigments were an essential constituent of De Heem\u2019s palette to give depth and transparency for shadowing. Red and yellow lakes are translucent pigments, prepared by the precipitation or adsorption of an organic dyestuff onto an insoluble substrate [34]. The organic dyestuff of the red lake cannot be detected by means of MA-XRF scanning. However, in this case, its distribution is visualized by the potassium image in Fig.\u00a05 that corresponds to the deep red and transparent glazes (Fig.\u00a05b, c, layer 4\u20135) for rendering the shadows and to model the tulip. As already previously observed in a technical study of Rembrandt\u2019s Self-portrait with MA-XRF scanning, the potassium distribution image appears to be a good marker for lake pigments [35]. The potassium signal probably stems from an inorganic potassium substrate on which the dyestuff was precipitated to obtain a granular pigment. Alum, a potassium aluminum sulfate (AlK(SO4)2.12H2O), was commonly used for the production of red lake pigments [36]. The alkali for this reaction was commonly lye prepared from wood ash, but could also originate from calcium-rich substrates such as chalk, marble dust, egg shells, or cuttlefish bone [36]. For all studied artworks, calcium and potassium fluorescence was detected in the rich yellow and deep red to purple glazed shadows of fruits, foliage and flowers. Lakes are suitable to obtain richly colored transparent glazes because the substrate itself is transparent in an oil medium [17].\n\nFig.\u00a05\n\nFlowers and Insects, a the painting with white rectangle indicating the area of interest.

This toned layer served as a basis for rendering the whitish stripes on top of the purplish glazes for the shadows, while the reddish vermilion and red lake paint defines the petals of the tulip in the reflection of the light. To obtain a purpler glaze, De Heem added a blue pigment in the mixture, identified as small particles of ultramarine (Na8\u201310Al6Si6O24S2\u20134) in the transparent red glaze (Fig.\u00a05b, c, layer 5). It is likely that De Heem used this high-quality blue pigment for all blue regions in the studied paintings. It was found in a mixture to paint the dew on grapes and plums, also referred to as \u2018mealie colour\u2019 in historical literature [16,] or highlights. The white lines of the white and purplish striped tulip were applied with lead white and some black particles (Fig.\u00a05b, c, layer 6).\nThe constituting elements of ultramarine, a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate, are difficult to detect by in situ MA-XRF scanning as the emitted low-energy fluorescence are easily absorbed by ambient air or superimposed paint and varnish layers. However, the presence of ultramarine can often be visualized in rich blue areas through the distribution of potassium, an impurity from the lapis lazuli stone that was left from the production process. To obtain purified ultramarine, the ground lapis lazuli is mixed with wax and kneaded in a dilute lye solution of potassium carbonate [33]. However, potassium can be found in other painting materials, such as the substrate of lakes, smalt or earth pigments, which complicates interpretation. Sometimes, its source can be deduced based on color, but in this case, a cross-section was available to ascertain ultramarine particles in the red lake glaze.\n\n\nCase study: The Orange in Festoon of Fruit and Flowers\n\nA previous study by Wallert demonstrated a neatly match between the build-up of the orange in the painting Festoon of Fruit and Flowers and painting instructions of Willem Beurs: \u201cNext to pomegranates it is best to place oranges, which can be found appropriately tempered on the day with vermilion, realgar, and dark yellow lake. When this is dry, they are glazed in the reflection with dark yellow lake, a bit of red lake, and in the shadows with red lake and a mixture of yellow lake with a tiny amount of black. On the day, highlights are made with just realgar, and if they are paler yellow, it is mixed with orpiment to make highlights.\u201d [10, 37]. The sequence of paint layers of that cross-section, taken from the day side of the orange, shows a layer of vermilion, yellow lake, lead white and earth pigments on the double ground, followed by a thin layer of lead white, silicon particles and earth pigments. This was covered by a thicker paint mixture of realgar and orpiment and a highlight of orpiment with gypsum. The chemical images of iron and mercury demonstrate a layer for the whole surface of the orange but are individually attenuated differently by the superimposed orpiment layer (As\u2013K). On the shadow side of the orange, the iron and mercury signal is, therefore, more abundant, since De Heem only applied the arsenic containing paint layers on the illuminated side. The deeper shadows on the fruit are visible in the element distribution images for calcium and potassium, possibly indicating the presence of yellow and red glazes as suggested by Beurs (Fig.\u00a06).\n\nFig.\u00a06\nPainting Festoon of Fruit and Flowers (a), light microscopic image (\u00d71000 magnification) in dark field of a cross-section taken from a highlight of an orange (b).

The ground rule was to start off with an underpainting, blocking out each figure in its own basic color, using pigments with strong hiding power and/or tinting strength and then gradually building up the tonality and form by applying local passages of transparent pigments in the upper paint layers. This particular system, in fact, favored characterizing the build-up of the paint layers with MA-XRF scanning. Pigments with more body, such as vermilion (HgS), lead white (PbCO3\u00b7Pb(OH)2) and umber (Fe2O3\u00b7(H2O)\u00a0+\u00a0MnO2) were often found in the ground, underpainting, or as small highlights in the upper layers. Those pigments are composed of elements with a high atomic number, and are consequently easier to detect with MA-XRF scanning and less influenced by attenuation. In addition, the superimposed layers are projected as a shadow on top of the fluorescence emission from subjacent layers. Therefore, the degree of attenuation and blocked fluorescence emission of the elements gave an insight in the layered sequence. In return, pigments with a smaller body and little hiding power, such as ultramarine and lakes, are composed of elements with a low atomic number and are highly influenced by attenuation and blocking by other elements. Since they are usually found in upper layers of the strata, the fluorescence emission of the elements is either not or to a lesser degree attenuated. Moreover, color information from the paint surface can ameliorate the ability to distinguish pigments with the same element composition.\nConclusionsIn this paper, a combination of MA-XRF scanning, microscopic cross-section analysis and art technical sources has been used to study the multi-layered painting technique of five seventeenth century flower and fruit still lifes from Jan Davidsz. de Heem. MA-XRF scanning proved to be significantly useful in the study of still life paintings. By presenting compositional information from the entire painted surface in a visual manner, the element distribution images could comprehend a large part of methods and materials used by De Heem, reveal changes in the painting process, visualize the condition of the art works and conservation treatments, and gain profound insights into how the paintings were constructed. With MA-XRF scanning, it was possible to recapture unique evidence of working methods: from the application of the ground layers to the characteristic shaped underpaintings, and finally, to the addition of multiple paint layers in the working up of the paintings. This revealed De Heem\u2019s systematic approach on how to achieve the perfect texture and luminescence for every subject. The chemical scans provided a view into the characteristic underpaintings, which he applied in an even color (usually lead white, vermilion or ochre) to mark the position of the main subjects in the composition. This is of importance since for this aspect in 17th century paintings, cross-section analysis, XRR and IRR are often of limited use. In X-rays, some of the undermodelling paint layers are visualized. With cross-sectional analysis, the composition of the underpainting can be identified. However, MA-XRF scanning goes beyond that by characterizing the locally applied shapes to specific elements. With this improved reading of multiple layers and stages of painting, also the interrelationship of the flower still life paintings become more obvious.In addition, microscopic cross-section analysis provided complimentary information to the elemental maps. It allowed the identification of pigments, especially those with the same element composition and offered depth selective information on the individual layers in the paintings. Examinations with SEM\u2013EDX allowed the detection of low Z elements to which MA-XRF is insensitive.In the end, the results obtained with scientific examination were compared with technical instructions and recipes from contemporary art historical technical sources. In this manner, De Heem\u2019s actual painting technique could be matched with recipes and suggestions described in the manuscript of Willem Beurs, het Groot schilderboeck of Gerard de Lairesse, as well as with notes and recipes from the painter himself in the manuscript of Daniel King Secrets in the Noble Arts of Miniature or Limning.\nUltimately, this interdisciplinary approach uncovered new information on De Heem\u2019s artistic practice and demonstrated as well how the techniques complement each other.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsNDK wrote the manuscript which was revised by GVdS, AL and KJ.

These have often focussed, however, on the most prominent artists, or on individual paintings. The National Gallery\u2019s long-term cataloguing programme was an opportunity to survey a wider range of artists, including not only Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan Gossaert but also lesser known painters from the same period. The results from the first stage of the programme, concentrating on the earlier paintings, were published in the 1997 volume of the National Gallery Technical Bulletin [2], a special issue on Early Northern European painting, and in the 1998 fifteenth-century school catalogue [3]. These findings were updated during more recent research on works by Rogier van der Weyden [4] and Jan van Eyck [5] that probed the materials in more detail. This took advantage of the more sophisticated analytical techniques now available, as did the examinations for the sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French school catalogue published in 2014 [6].The cataloguing programme included technical examination of all the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French paintings in the National Gallery, around 120 in total. Certain works were studied in more depth than others, but for almost all of them at least a few samples were taken to investigate paint composition and layer structure. It was not possible, or appropriate, to describe the analyses in detail in these scholarly art-historical catalogues. The purpose of this article is therefore to present a selection of the scientific results behind the brief summaries included in the technical notes of each entry in the published catalogues, concentrating here on a few topics of particular interest. Some of the findings have already been published in articles focussed on certain materials [7, 8], but here they are augmented with further new results and are brought together to consider their use in the specific context of Netherlandish paintings. This overview also provides insight into the technical changes that accompany the changes in style evident when moving from the fifteenth to the sixteenth century.The pigments found in the fifteenth-century paintings were familiar\u2014verdigris for greens, azurite and ultramarine for the blues, vermilion, red lead and red lakes for the reds and so on. Of most interest were two materials that functioned not as pigments but as additives to modify the properties of the paint; colourless powdered glass, and zinc sulphate, also known as zinc vitriol or white vitriol. These were also seen in the sixteenth-century works, but there were differences among the pigments when compared to the earlier paintings, such as the occasional use of the rare pigments fluorite and vivianite, and more significantly the introduction of the blue pigment smalt and a green mineral pigment composed predominantly of a copper sulphate.\nPaint additives\nColourless powdered glass\nColourless powdered glass has so far proved to be the more common of the two additives discussed here. It was first reported in 2003 in paintings by the Italian artists Raphael and Perugino [9, 10], identified by the conchoidal fracture lines and jagged shape of particles seen in paint cross-sections, as well as the characteristic series of elements detected by SEM\u2013EDX analysis. It quickly became apparent, however, that it was present in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century paintings from all over Europe [9, 11, 12]. In the subsequent broader study of this additive in 70 paintings in the National Gallery, published in 2012, forty of the examples were in Italian paintings [8]. Although this apparent geographical bias may reflect to some extent the greater number of samples from Italian paintings that have been analysed with this material in mind, it is consistent with the comment made by the English painter Marshall Smith in 1693 that it was \u2018much used in Italy\u2019 [13]. Among the 29 Northern European occurrences discovered in National Gallery paintings during the 2012 study are 15 in Netherlandish works, 12 from Germany and 2 from France [8]. Five more were found subsequently during cataloguing of the sixteenth-century Netherlandish paintings, to which can be added the examples that have been reported in paintings from other collections [14, 15]. The earliest known occurrence so far is in a German work, Lucas Moser\u2019s Tiefenbronn Altarpiece of 1432 [15], while the earliest among the National Gallery paintings was in a Netherlandish work, The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, painted only 2\u00a0years later in 1434 (Fig.\u00a01) [8]. Van Eyck added it to his purple and red glazes in this portrait, as he did again in The Annunciation (1434\u201336, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC), where it is also a component of the mordant for the gilding. His use of a material that was not a pigment but that would have influenced the properties of the paint is especially interesting given the pivotal role he is thought to have played in the development of oil painting technique [5].\n\nFig.\u00a01\n\na Jan van Eyck, The Arnolfini Portrait (NG186), 1434, oil on oak, 82.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060\u00a0cm; b paint cross-section from the man\u2019s plum-coloured robe, showing a thick layer of red lake, ultramarine and colourless powdered glass, on top of which is a thin ultramarine layer which appears light because it is degraded and blanched; c backscattered electron SEM image of the cross-section, with the glass particles circled in red; d silicon EDX map of the cross-section with the glass particles circled in red (the other silicon-containing particles are ultramarine); e EDX spectrum of one of the glass particles showing the characteristic series of elements. Images \u00a9 National Gallery, London\n\n\nColourless powdered glass is mentioned in numerous historic documentary sources, in recipes for boiled oils, as an additive mixed with the paint on the palette, as an ingredient in a mordant for gilding, and occasionally to aid in the grinding of orpiment. The texts often suggest that it was a siccative for oil, and whatever the outcome of the further experiments needed to provide decisive proof that it is effective for this purpose, the belief that it could perform this function may have been the main reason that artists used it (at least in paintings, rather than the other contexts in which this material is sometimes mentioned). This does not preclude the possibility that they appreciated, in addition, any effect it had on the optical or handling properties of the paint [8, 14, 15]. The review of the documentary sources published in 2012 in the National Gallery Technical Bulletin [8] includes references to this material in a few fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century treatises, but the earliest that states explicitly that it was added as a siccative\u2014in this case for orpiment bound in oil\u2014is Richard Haydocke\u2019s 1598 translation of Lomazzo, in a marginal note by Haydocke that does not appear in the original Italian treatise. It is most often recommended as an addition to improve the drying of oil paint containing red lakes or blacks. The published occurrences indeed indicate that it was most commonly mixed with these pigments, although certain artists such as Raphael [8] and Holbein the Elder [15] seem to have used it rather more extensively in other colours. Three of the five new occurrences published here (Table\u00a01) are in paint containing red lake or black, although in one it is combined with vermilion (another poor drying pigment) and in another it is in a green mixture which, although it includes some black pigment, is composed predominantly of lead white and lead\u2013tin yellow. In this last example powdered glass may have been added because the green is an underpaint, where rapid drying would allow the upper layers to be applied without much delay; this is perhaps similar to the numerous paintings where it was used in primings, even though they contain lead white which itself aids drying of the oil [8].Table\u00a01\nQuantitative analysis of the colourless powdered glass additive in five of the sixteenth-century Netherlandish paintings in the National Gallery, London (expressed as weight percent oxide)\nArtist, painting title, dateAreas with powdered glass in the paintGlass typeNa2OMgOAl2O3\nSiO2\nP2O5\nSO3\nK2OCaOTiO2\nMnOFeOAlbert Cornelis, The Magdalen in a Landscape (NG2585), c.1520Pink robe of the angel, with lead white, fluorite and red lake: two types of glassWood ash\u2013lime (high lime\u2013low potash)2.84.02.256.03.60.74.824.20.20.60.5Wood ash2.25.72.058.64.00.87.817.00.20.70.5Attributed to Jan Mostaert, The Head of Saint John the Baptist, with Mourning Angels (NG1080), probably 1520sRed paint beneath the oblong area painted with figures, with vermilionWood ash\u2013lime (high lime\u2013low potash)3.63.71.954.74.46.13.520.00.41.00.6Lucas Van Leyden, A Man aged 38 (NG3604), about 1521Purple robe, in underpaint, with red lake, azurite, lead white, red earth, and in the final glazes with red lake: three types of glassSoda ash11.62.01.266.62.01.82.69.10.50.80.3Wood ash2.14.91.957.73.81.49.616.40.20.70.6Wood ash\u2013lime (high lime\u2013low potash)1.54.21.856.93.91.95.821.60.21.00.5Workshop of the Master of the Holy Blood, A Young Man Praying (NG1063), probably 1525\u201330Black coat, with black and a little lead whiteWood ash0.53.92.060.61.93.37.218.90.20.70.5Catharina van Hemessen, Portrait of a Woman (NG4732), 1551Green background, in underpaint (with lead white, black, lead\u2013tin yellow); two types of glassWood ash\u2013lime (high lime\u2013low potash)2.82.93.359.43.00.83.921.80.40.50.6Wood ash2.14.32.154.54.25.110.814.20.20.70.9\n\nThe anonymous late sixteenth-century French manuscript from Toulouse BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris), not included in the earlier review [8], mentions colourless ground glass several times. It is being transcribed and translated for an online critical edition during \u2018The Making and Knowing Project\u2019 directed by Pamela H. Smith at Columbia University, New York [16]. This historical source, in the form of a \u2018book of secrets\u2019, is especially helpful in furthering understanding of the motivation behind the use of this additive, since it gives a more explicit explanation as to why it might have been used, and what properties it was considered to confer to the oil paint.\nOn the verso of page 56 it states that \u2018Lake takes a long time to dry in oil, and for that reason you have to grind some glass with it. But you have to choose crystallin, because it is cleaner.\u2019 Crystallin at this time would have meant clear colourless glass containing manganese as a decolorizer to counteract the greenish tint caused by the iron naturally present in the silica source used for ordinary glass. This seems invariably to have been the type of glass used as an additive in paintings, since the quantitative analyses show that in every case some manganese is present [8]. It is well known that manganese can act as a siccative for oil, although it is not yet clear whether this element is sufficiently mobile in the glass to perform this function, and it may be that the alkali content proves to be more important in this respect [8]. In northern European glass manganese is likely to have been introduced as part of the wood ash used as the flux, rather than as a separate component [17].\nThe passage on page 56 in this manuscript goes on to say \u2018And because it would be too difficult to grind it as it is, it must be made red hot in the fire, then once completely red throw it into cold water and it will crumble and become powdery and then be ground easily. After being well ground in a lot of water, it looks like ground lead white, but, despite this, it does not in fact have body.\u2019 The verso of page 57 expands on this last phrase, stating that \u2018Crystallin having been ground in water appears to have body, but in oil it does not have any. It is ground with lake and with aspalthe, which will not dry for a very long time without it.\u2019 As in other treatises, the ground glass is to be mixed with red lake and a black pigment as a siccative.\nOn the verso of page 65 it is suggested that glass could also be added for another purpose. In a passage on glazing, it states that \u2018One usually glazes with colours that do not have any body, such as lake and verdigris. However, in order to use other colours, [in other words, more opaque pigments] one mixes them with a quantity of calcined and ground crystallin, which also does not have any body, reducing their density.\u2019 A note in the margin of page 65 recto clarifies what is meant, stating that \u2018Every colour or thing which appears dense when mixed with water, on being ground, has body. But those which do not have it [body], such as crushed glass and lake etc., are made clear.\u2019 It is evident that here materials without body are translucent, and that in this case the powdered glass is certainly being used to alter the optical properties of the paint. This passage, however, concerns paints for decorating cast metal objects where glazes that allowed the metal surface to shine through were required. It is made clear that it is not needed to increase translucency when using inherently translucent pigments such as red lakes. This source makes it evident that crushed colourless glass could have several purposes, but the manner in which it has been used in paintings suggests that there it was intended as a siccative. It was mixed not only with red lakes and blacks\u2014both poorly drying pigments\u2014but also used in mordants for gilding where it would have no optical function since it was hidden beneath gold leaf, and in primings where again it would be covered by paint [8].\nIn addition to revealing the presence of manganese, the quantitative SEM\u2013EDX analyses indicate the type of glass in each case. This is dependent on the raw materials used to make it, including the silica source, whether pebbles or sand, and especially the type of ash that was the source of the alkali flux. In the Mediterranean area the ash of coastal halophytic plants was used, producing soda-ash glass rich in sodium, as found in all except one of the Italian paintings analysed at the National Gallery. Glass of this type was also identified in the National Gallery\u2019s Northern European paintings, including five of the twelve German works (see table in [8]). Several more examples in German works were published by Lutzenberger, who also found it in one Netherlandish work by Colijn de Coter painted before 1510 [14]. Another Netherlandish occurrence is added here; Lucas Van Leyden\u2018s, A Man aged 38 (NG3604) of about 1521 (Table\u00a01). In the fifteenth century and the early sixteenth century this glass is likely to have been imported from Italy, although a little later soda-ash glass was being made in the Netherlands following the arrival of Italian glassmakers in centres such as Antwerp [18].\nIn Netherlandish paintings calco-potassic glass made with potassium-rich wood ash or fern ash was more common. The main constituents, in addition to silica, are varying amounts of potassium and calcium, with lesser but still significant amounts of magnesium. From the thousands of analyses of vessel and window glass several compositional categories have been identified based on the proportions of K2O and CaO (see references and summary in [8]). The calcium originates either from the inclusion of lime in the recipe or from the ash, depending on the type of wood, the growing conditions or the proportion of trunk to twigs (the bark being richer in calcium). Glasses with potassium and calcium contents (as weight percentage oxide) ranging from roughly equal up to one and a half or two times as much calcium as potassium are generally designated as wood ash glasses. An example of glass in this category is the second type identified in Catharina van Hemessen\u2019s Portrait of a Woman (NG 4732) (Table\u00a01). Where more calcium is present, above 20% CaO, together with relatively high levels of K2O of 6\u20139% it can be categorised as wood ash\u2013lime. All of the wood ash\u2013lime glass in Table\u00a01 is of another type within this category, generally called high lime\u2013low alkali, with a much lower level of K2O at only 3.5\u20135% and high levels of calcium at 20\u201325%.\nLooking at the type of glass when the Netherlandish paintings are listed in chronological order (Table\u00a02) an interesting trend emerges. Quantitative results have been obtained from 19 of the 23 paintings containing powdered glass. Of these, ten are high lime\u2012low alkali glass, but they all date from after 1470. This mirrors the patterns identified from the extensive past analyses done on vessel glass, which have shown that this type of glass starts to become common only from the end of the fifteenth century onwards in the Netherlands [19]. Only one of the examples dates from before 1500\u2014Christ crowned with Thorns (NG1083) by Dirk Bouts, which is thought to have been painted around 1470. It is worth noting that this painting has been in the past attributed to Albrecht Bouts rather than his father Dirk and given a date of around 1500 [20], although it is only with a greater number of results that it will be possible to say with more certainty whether this type of glass has a bearing on the date or whether it was already being used in paintings by the 1470s. This trend in the composition of glass in paintings, presented already as a tentative hypothesis in 2012 [8], is strengthened considerably by the results added here from sixteenth-century paintings (Table\u00a01), which include four occurrences of high lime\u2013low alkali glass. The composition of the glass may prove to be useful in dating of a work, and could be especially helpful for distinguishing later variants from earlier works produced by certain studios such as the Bouts workshop, where later generations of artists continued to use the same models or patterns for their compositions transmitted through drawings.Table\u00a02\nType of colourless powdered glass additive in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Netherlandish paintings in the National Gallery, London, in chronological order\nArtistPainting (medium and support)DateType(s) of glassJan van Eyck\nPortrait of Giovanni(?)

This was most probably incorporated in the form of zinc sulphate (zinc vitriol, white vitriol, white copperas), which, like powdered glass is recommended as a siccative for oil in various historical documentary sources, or as an ingredient in the preparation of boiled oils [5]. It is also an ingredient in a red lake recipe in the German fifteenth-century Tegernsee manuscript [21], making it possible that it is associated with the pigment, but in another work by Jan van Eyck, the portrait of his wife, Margaret (Groeningemuseum, Bruges), it is not only present in the red lake glazes on her dress but also in the black background [5]. This suggests it is more likely to have been added to the paint rather than being part of the red lake. The same is true in another example, a portrait by the sixteenth-century French artist Fran\u00e7ois Quesnel, where it was located in the pinkish priming, together with lead white and a little red lead (Fig.\u00a02).\n\nFig.\u00a02\n\na Fran\u00e7ois Quesnel, Portrait of a Lady (NG2617), about 1575, oil on oak, 36.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a027.6\u00a0cm; b paint cross-section from the purple\u2013pink dress, showing the light orange priming consisting of lead white, a little red lead and a little zinc sulphate, on top of which is a light blue layer of smalt and lead white, followed by a pink layer of lead white, red lake and smalt, followed by a final deeper layer of red lake and smalt; c backscattered electron SEM image of the cross-section; d zinc EDX map showing the zinc sulphate in the priming, e potassium EDX map showing the areas where potassium is associated with zinc; f EDX spectrum from a zinc- and potassium-rich area showing that potassium is associated with the zinc; g silicon EDX map showing the location of the smalt particles. Images \u00a9 National Gallery, London\n\n\nA zinc-rich yellow earth pigment has been found in Venetian sixteenth-century paintings [22], however, and it is therefore important to establish that the zinc really is present as zinc sulphate, and hence has been added as zinc vitriol. In Titian\u2019s Portrait of a Man (NG1944), the SEM\u2013EDX analyses indicated clearly that zinc and sulphur are located together in the same zones in the priming. ATR-FTIR microspectroscopic imaging on a cross-section confirmed they are present in the form of zinc sulphate, the spectra showing a characteristic infrared absorption band at around 1070\u00a0cm\u22121. Infrared absorption bands at 1530, 1454 and 1397\u00a0cm\u22121 further indicated that the zinc has reacted with the oil binder to form zinc soaps, which are evident as large translucent inclusions [23].\nSince few occurrences of zinc vitriol as an additive have been confirmed, all those identified so far in National Gallery paintings, from all over Europe, are listed in Table\u00a03. Most of these identifications rely only on SEM\u2013EDX analysis, but ATR-FTIR imaging was carried out wherever possible to confirm that zinc was indeed present as zinc sulphate (although not all the cross-sections were suitable for this type of analysis). The list includes, in addition to the works by Van Eyck and Fran\u00e7ois Quesnel, four early paintings by Titian (zinc vitriol has not been found in his later works), four paintings from Ferrara and Bologna of about the same date, a seventeenth-century painting by Vermeer, an eighteenth-century Dutch flower painting by Jan van Huysum, and several works made in Germany. The earliest of these is a mid fifteenth-century panel by Stefan Lochner, who worked in Cologne [24]. A broader study of paintings by this artist carried out by the Doerner Institut, Munich, in collaboration with the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, detected zinc in nearly every painting in areas of red lake and in the blacks, indicating that zinc vitriol was quite commonly used as an additive in Cologne in this period [27]. The geographically dispersed occurrences in Table\u00a03, ranging in date from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, are in keeping with the frequent references to zinc vitriol in historical documentary sources over this whole period. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as noted in a review by Carlyle, it was \u2018a popular ingredient in drying oil recipes and in combinations of driers such as \u201cPatent dryer\u201d\u2019 [28], and it seems likely that it will prove to be more common than the examples identified so far might suggest, even in earlier works. Charles Lock Eastlake, the first Director of the National Gallery, proclaimed it to be the favourite drier of Netherlandish painters, on the basis of his review of Northern European historic treatises in his 1847 book Materials for a History of Oil Painting [29].Table\u00a03\nOccurrences of zinc sulphate as an additive in National Gallery paintings (chronological order)\nArtistPaintingDateLocation of zinc as a drier in the paintingNetherlandish paintings\u00a0Jan van Eyck\nPortrait of Giovanni(?)

One of these exhibits a complex sulphate infrared absorption band with the maximum centred around 1040\u00a0cm\u22121 together with additional small sharp bands at c.1157 and 966\u00a0cm\u22121, and correlates with areas found by SEM\u2013EDX to contain only Zn, S and O; the other, with a single broad band at c.1060\u201270\u00a0cm\u22121, corresponds to areas containing some potassium in addition [23]. The spectra from the potassium-containing areas are not an exact match to published data for known potassium zinc sulphates such as K2Zn(SO4)2\u00b76H2O [30], and further work is needed to fully identify these species. Nevertheless similar results were obtained from two other paintings by Titian where it was possible to carry out ATR-FTIR imaging, and from the painting by Fran\u00e7ois Quesnel (Table\u00a03 and [23]). The samples from the other paintings in the table were either not suitable for ATR-FTIR imaging, or where this was possible the spectra were not sufficiently distinct. Reassessment of the SEM\u2013EDX results did, however, confirm the presence of potassium in conjunction with the zinc sulphate in every case, at least where no potassium-containing pigments such as red lake or ultramarine were present to interfere with the analyses, including in the portrait by Fran\u00e7ois Quesnel, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. The source of white vitriol was the mineral goslarite (ZnSO4\u00b77H2O), and although potassium could be present as an impurity it is also possible that it was introduced through some sort of processing before use. Zinc acts as a secondary or auxiliary drier, but it may be that its effectiveness is dependent on its preparation, since the experiments using pure zinc sulphate in the heptahydrate form published so far have shown rather variable results [31]. Comments in the historical literature also seem to indicate it might not always be reliable for this purpose. Laurie (1895, [32]) states that it is ineffective, but that the sulphate of zinc mentioned in early treatises worked as a drier because it was not pure (although he speculates that this was because manganese was present as an impurity), and Church (1915, [33]) comments that \u2018Another dryer in common use is white vitriol or sulphate of zinc. Its siccative character is very slight.\u2019 Interestingly, given the potassium content in the zinc sulphate found in paintings, Samuel Frederick Gray (1830), under the heading \u2018boiled oil\u2019 states: \u2018The pure sulphate of zinc made in England has not the same drying quality as the common white vitriol imported from Germany\u2019 [34].\n\nDevelopments in colour and the use of pigmentsTowards the end of the fifteenth century a change in style occurs at the same time as a shift towards less saturated colours and more subtle hues, as can be seen when comparing The Virgin and Child Enthroned by Quentin Massys (Fig.\u00a03) painted about 1506\u20129 with The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck (Fig.\u00a01) dated 1434. This is accompanied by a change in technique that is evident, for example, in the build-up of the modelling in the draperies. Rather than using an opaque red paint for the base layers of red draperies, as Van Eyck would have done, Massys underpainted the whole of the Virgin\u2019s cloak in various shades of grey, as can be seen in the cross section (Fig.\u00a03b), before glazing it with red lake to give a soft purplish pink colour. Similarly, the green drapery of the angel at the right of the painting has, beneath a green verdigris glaze, an orange\u2013red base colour that modifies the tone in a subtle way, rather than an opaque green underpaint as would have been typical in fifteenth-century painting (Fig.\u00a03c). This search for more nuanced hues might also be why two more unusual pigments, blue vivianite and purple fluorite, were found in a small number of the sixteenth-century paintings, although it may simply have been a question of availability or perhaps even a need for cheaper pigments to extend the expensive blues and red lakes. The blue hydrated iron phosphate pigment vivianite was used, for example, in another painting by Massys, Christ (NG295.1), mixed with red lake, lead white, a little azurite and black in the underpaint for Christ\u2019s red cloak. In the companion panel, The Virgin (NG295.2), the underpaint for the ultramarine blue cloak is a mixture of lead white and purple fluorite (mineral calcium fluoride). Purple fluorite is most common in paintings from southern Germany and the Tyrol [12], where there are well-known deposits of the mineral. It has also been identified, although far more rarely, in some Netherlandish paintings and while the mineral may have been imported from Germany, it is possible that it came from a more local source such as that in the Fagne/Famenne region of modern-day Belgium [35]. Four occurrences in National Gallery paintings were published in 2000 [7]. Since they are so few in number it is worth reporting here the two further examples in Netherlandish works in the collection discovered since then, and three more in paintings from other collections (analysed by the author and published elsewhere [36, 37]), to bring up to date our understanding of its use in sixteenth-century painting in the Netherlands (Table\u00a04). Purple fluorite has been also reported in a painting entitled \u2018A Man in Red\u2019 thought to have been produced in the Netherlands in the 1530s [38].\n\nFig.\u00a03\n\na Quinten Massys, The Virgin and Child Enthroned, with Four Angels (NG6282), about 1506\u20139, oil on oak, 62.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a043.5\u00a0cm; b paint cross-section from the Virgin\u2019s red cloak, showing the chalk ground (the upper zone of which is more translucent), followed by a thin off white priming, a grey underpaint of lead white and a little black and finally a translucent layer of red lake; c paint cross-section from the green robe of the angel at the right, showing the chalk ground and very thin off white priming, followed by a beige underpaint of lead white, haematite, black and a little red lead, a further undermodelling layer containing a similar mixture but with more haematite, and finally a green layer of verdigris that has reacted with the oil binder to form a homogeneous translucent film.

It seems to have been mixed most often with red lake to give a soft purple-pink colour, for example in the angel\u2019s robe in The Magdalen in a Landscape (NG2585) by Albert Cornelis [40], and in the sleeves of Gossaert\u2019s A Man holding a Glove (NG946) [41]. This portrait was painted in the early 1530s, and most of the occurrences in the table are from the second or third decade of the sixteenth century. For several of these paintings, however, there are considerable uncertainties in the dating and the attributions, making it difficult to draw firmer conclusions about the distribution in the use of purple fluorite in Netherlandish paintings in terms of date range and geographical location.\nThe introduction of the blue pigment smalt during the sixteenth century\nThe blue pigment smalt, a cobalt-containing potash glass, seems to have been used only rarely before the beginning of the sixteenth century [42]. The occurrences in the paintings in this study bear this out; this pigment was employed in only one of the fifteenth-century works, The Entombment by Dirk Bouts (NG664, probably 1450s), but was identified in eleven of the paintings in the sixteenth-century schools catalogue, shown in Table\u00a05 in chronological order. The earliest of these, the Man with Pansies and a Skull by a follower of Jan van Scorel, dates from about 1535. Smalt is present in the collar and sleeves, where it is mixed with fluorite, lead white and azurite. All the other examples date from after 1550, after which smalt becomes extremely common across most of Europe.Table\u00a05\nOccurrences of smalt in Netherlandish and French sixteenth-century paintings in the National Gallery, in chronological order, with quantitative elemental analysis (weight% oxide) and Co:As ratio (atomic%)\nArtist, painting and dateLocation of smaltNa2OAl2O3\nSiO2\nK2OCaOFeOCoONiOAs2O3\nBi2O3\nCo/As at.%Follower of Jan van Scorel A Man with Pansies and a Skull (NG1036), about 1535Purple sleeves, mixed with fluorite, lead white and azurite__________\n_\nMaster of the Prodigal Son, Piet\u00e0 (NG266), about 1550Virgin\u2019s blue cloak__________\n_\nPieter Breughel the Elder, The Adoration of the Kings (NG3556), 1564Virgin\u2019s blue cloak and sky (with lead white)0.30.259.815.93.76.7\n7.7\n0.73.61.3\n2.8\nJoachim Beuckelaer, The Four Elements: Earth (NG6585), 1569Beige (discoloured) paint of apron of woman in background0.20.669.811.30.43.5\n5.1\n0.67.51.2\n0.9\nJoachim Beuckelaer.

The extensive use of this pigment in the four paintings of The Four Elements series by Joachim Beuckelaer has meant that many areas have changed colour dramatically. A range of blues, purples, lilacs and purple\u2013pinks were intended, but the sleeves of the woman in the detail at the right in Fig.\u00a04 which would have been blue are now grey, while those of the woman in the detail at the left, painted with a layer of smalt over a red paint containing mainly red lake and therefore meant to be purplish, are now also mostly grey with a hint of pink where the red underlayer is showing through. The blue colour of smalt derives from tetrahedral coordination of the cobalt in the glass, stabilised by potassium ions, but potassium is leached when it degrades, so that the equilibrium moves towards octahedral coordination with concurrent loss of colour [43, 44]. When the pigment is in good condition it contains around 12\u201215\u00a0weight% K2O [43\u201245], but it can be seen in Table\u00a05 that the smalt analysed in two of the Beuckelaers contains only around 2\u20123%. In Earth, the third of the series, although there seems to be more potassium present at around 11\u201212\u00a0wt% oxide, it is not better preserved overall; the results reported are for one particle of smalt that retains its colour because it is large, chosen for analysis because it is more representative of the original composition of the smalt than the deteriorated particles. Smalt was available to artists in different grades that varied in the intensity of colour, so the quantitative analysis, through the potassium content, is useful in distinguishing between a smalt that was always pale and one that is weak in colour due to degradation [45]. The few greyish-blue smalt particles in the sample from the sitter\u2019s dress in the portrait by Fran\u00e7ois Quesnel, for example (Fig.\u00a02), contain only around 4\u00a0wt% K2O and therefore are not a pale grade but are degraded, as is the rest of the smalt in the sample, which has lost its colour completely. The cobalt content gives an indication of the original strength of colour; at 4.8\u00a0wt% CoO content, the pigment would originally have been a strong blue.\n\nFig.\u00a04\n\na Joachim Beuckelaer, The Four Elements: Air (NG6587), 1570, detail showing the woman at the left; b Joachim Beuckelaer, The Four Elements: Fire (NG6588), 1570, detail showing the woman at the left. Images \u00a9 National Gallery, London\n\n\nThe intensity of colour in smalt depends on the particle size (finely ground pigment being paler) and on the cobalt content. Different grades were sold distinguished by one or other, or both, of these factors. To be able to recognise a low or high grade based on the cobalt content, it is necessary to consider the broader context of the composition of this pigment. The quantitative analyses included here are part of a broad study of smalt that has included seventy National Gallery paintings so far, ranging in date from the very beginning of the sixteenth century to the first decade of the nineteenth century. An interesting pattern in the cobalt content has emerged. Some of the smalt in the sixteenth-century paintings is very rich in cobalt, such as that in Pieter Brueghel the Elder\u2019s Adoration of the Kings, which contains almost 8\u00a0wt% CoO. In all of the paintings in Table\u00a05 dating from before 1600 the cobalt oxide content is above 4\u20135\u00a0wt%. A few of paintings in the broader study dating from after 1600 contain a little above 5\u00a0wt% CoO, but it is more often around 3%, less than half that measured in the Brueghel [45]. Historic documentary sources seem to indicate that the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century is a period of many changes in the trade in cobalt ore and the smalt making industry. In the sixteenth century smalt made in the Netherlands was famous for its high quality, and smalt was manufactured in a limited number of places, mainly in the Netherlands, due to the strong control over trade in cobalt ore that they had established, and in Saxony, close to the cobalt deposits. At the beginning of the seventeenth century smalt began to be made in more places, and it may be that this led to a reduction of the quality of the smalt, or perhaps manufacturers found they could economise by using less cobalt ore and still achieve a marketable product [45].\nThe arsenic content in the smalt analyses in Table\u00a05 is considerable, in most cases far exceeding that of cobalt. The most common cobalt ores were arsenates and arsenides, found in the deposits in Saxony that were until the eighteenth century the only source in Europe of cobalt, and typically also containing small amounts of nickel, iron and bismuth. The ore was prepared by first roasting it to remove some of the arsenic. It is clear from the analyses that the degree to which this was done was variable, as evident from the Co/As ratios in Table\u00a05, which allow distinction between variations due to differences in the roasting and those due simply to the amount of cobalt ore that was used. In most cases the amount of cobalt is around half that of arsenic, but the smalt in the Adoration by Breughel is instead rather low in arsenic, with the amount of cobalt being more than twice as much. Clearer trends are likely to become evident as more results become available; it is interesting that a recent study of smalt in paintings by Titian and Veronese in the National Gallery showed these to all be rich in arsenic [46]. Arsenic can act as either a network modifier or former in the glass. From the few initial studies by Raman and FTIR microscopy it seems to be behaving as the latter in smalt [44], and in the melt it can also function as a fining agent. Differences in the arsenic content in smalt may therefore be of significance and indicate deliberate choices in the preparation of the ore that manufacturers had discovered would improve the quality of the product, although further research is needed to understand this fully.\n\nGreen mineral copper sulphate pigments\nThe only green pigment identified in the earlier works among the National Gallery\u2019s Netherlandish paintings was verdigris, but in those from the late fifteenth century and onwards into the sixteenth century a surprising number of occurrences were identified of a green copper mineral pigment composed mainly of a copper sulphate; sixteen are listed in Table\u00a06. A few of these had been already discovered before the cataloguing programme, such as that in the green background of the portrait attributed to a follower of Jan van Scorel (NG1036), and in the green areas of The Magdalen in a Landscape by Albert Cornelis (NG2585) [7]. Here, and in most of the other examples, the copper sulphate was accompanied, in addition to a little malachite, by some silica in the form of quartz and some potassium feldspar, so is likely to be a natural mineral rather than an artificially made copper green. In the Cornelis, and in the portrait by a follower of Jan van Scorel, it was possible to carry out Raman microscopy, which confirmed that in these cases the mineral is posnjakite (Cu4SO4(OH)6\u00b7H2O) [7], although other copper sulphates, most commonly brochantite (Cu4SO4(OH)6), but also langite (Cu4SO4(OH)6\u00b72H2O) have also been reported in paintings [47]. Posnjakite forms elongated lath-like crystals and tends towards blue\u2013green in colour, while brochantite is a more emerald green, with more rectangular tabular particles. In some of the paint cross-sections, particles of different hues and shapes are evident that might indicate more than one type of copper sulphate is present, for example in Gerard David\u2019s Canon Bernardijn Salviati and Three Saints (NG1045) (Fig.\u00a05). The two different FTIR spectra obtained from green particles by ATR-FTIR imaging on a paint cross-section from The Virgin and Child in a Landscape (NG1864) by Albert Cornelis and Associates suggest a mixture of different copper sulphate minerals. That from a lath-like bluish-green particle was similar to a reference standard of antlerite (Cu3SO4(OH)4), while that from a grass-green particle was closer to the reference standard of brochantite (Cu4(SO4)(OH)6), but in practice it is difficult to confirm these identifications, especially since the spectral sensitivity of the focal plane array detector does not extend below 900\u00a0cm\u22121, and further analyses with micro-XRD and Raman microscopy will be necessary. The elongated blue\u2013green crystals seen in the sample from Marten van Heemskerck\u2019s The Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist (NG6508.1) are most typical of the particles seen in the samples listed in Table\u00a06. In this painting previous analyses had mistakenly identified the pigment as azurite [48], while in other cases such as the painting by Gerard David, it had been thought to be malachite. ATR-FTIR imaging has proved useful in making these distinctions even if it is not always able to determine the precise copper sulphate species (Fig.\u00a06).Table\u00a06\nOccurrences of mineral copper sulphate pigment in sixteenth-century Netherlandish paintings in the in the National Gallery\nArtistDateLocation of mineral copper sulphate pigment on the paintingIdentification methodGerard David, Canon Bernardijn Salviati and Three Saints (NG1045)After 1501Brownish-green of the trees at the top left; green mineral pigment composed of mainly copper sulphate, probably some malachite, and some potassium aluminium silicate (Al, Si, K), mixed with lead white and lead\u2013tin yellow, with a green verdigris glaze at the surfaceSEM\u2013EDXGerard David, Lamentation (NG1078)1515\u201323Bright green highlight on the tree in the middle distance; green mineral pigment composed of mainly copper sulphate (some of which contains a little potassium) and probably some malachite, mixed with lead\u2013tin yellow and lead whiteSEM\u2013EDXQuinten Massys, An Old Woman (\u2018The Ugly Duchess\u2019) (NG5769)About 1513Green background; green mineral pigment composed of mainly copper sulphate, with a small amount of malachite and associated alumino-silicates (Al, Si) in the underpaint, mixed with lead white and lead\u2013tin yellow.

Images \u00a9 National Gallery, London\n\n\nThe paintings in Table\u00a06 range in date from the beginning of the sixteenth century to around 1540. A few scattered occurrences in other paintings of this period from the Netherlands as well as in some manuscripts had been reported in the past. The identification of posnjakite (using X-ray diffraction) in paintings by Jan van Scorel was published already in 1977 [49], and here an example is reported in a portrait by a follower of this artist. Other occurrences of this same mineral reliably identified by X-ray diffraction were reported in 1978, in The Last Judgement by Lucas van Leyden (1526\u20127) [50], and in 1992 in three paintings by Jan Massys [51]. It was identified in two of the National Gallery paintings by Jan\u2019s father, Quinten Massys, in the green background in The Ugly Duchess of about 1513, and in the landscape in The Crucifixion of about 1515, considered to be from his workshop. More recently, the HERCULES cultural heritage laboratory at \u00c9vora University found that it was used extensively in works by the sixteenth-century artist Frei Carlos, who worked in Portugal but was originally from the Low Countries [47]. The MINIARE project at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, on the materials of manuscripts, identified copper sulphates in an early sixteenth-century Book of Hours illuminated by a group of Netherlandish artists [52], as well as in a manuscript illuminated by Simon Bening dating from 1522\u20123 [53].\nSecondary copper minerals such as malachite and copper sulphates are found in the location of copper deposits, formed especially on the tailings of copper mines. They were most probably sold under the names mountain green (berggr\u00fcn, vert de montaigne, etc.) or verdeazurro (vert d\u2019azur) [54], this last name being especially appropriate for the rather blue\u2013green copper sulphates reported here. Artists would not, of course, have been able to distinguish the copper sulphates from pigments composed mainly of malachite, or of other complex mixtures of green copper minerals such as those that have been found in Italian paintings [55]. Copper mineral pigments composed of mainly malachite are more common in paintings, and the regular use of a mountain green that is predominantly copper sulphate in Netherlandish paintings of the sixteenth century is likely to indicate a particular deposit as a source. More research on trade links or on the minerals in historic copper mining locations may provide further understanding of why this pigment appears in this location at this time.\nThis green copper mineral pigment was not used as an alternative to verdigris, since in several of the paintings both pigments are present, the more translucent verdigris being used in glazes on top of more opaque greens containing copper sulphate mineral. In Gerard David\u2019s Canon Bernardijn Salviati and Three Saints (NG1045) (Fig.\u00a05) a mixture of copper sulphate mineral with lead white and lead\u2013tin yellow is used for the lighter more opaque greens in the landscape, while the darkest greens in the leaves are applied on top in verdigris. In Marten van Heemskerck\u2019s The Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist (NG6508.1) (Fig.\u00a06), mineral copper sulphate is present mixed with varying proportions of lead white for the undermodelling of Saint John\u2019s drapery, which has then been glazed with a deep green layer of verdigris.\n\nConclusionsBringing together the results from the technical examinations of the materials in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French paintings during the National Gallery cataloguing programmes, and re-evaluating them in the context of earlier research has provided new insights, strengthening the earlier hypotheses made on the basis of fewer analyses. The colourless powdered glass found often as a paint additive in paintings of this period shows interesting trends in composition, with glass of a high lime\u2012low alkali composition predominating in the later paintings, an observation that could be useful in helping to date paintings in the future. Zinc sulphate, although less common than glass as an additive, was nevertheless more widespread than has been recognised, and it is important to be aware that it can be present in these early paintings when carrying out non-invasive analyses, since the detection of zinc might be mistakenly interpreted as indicating the presence of zinc white in later non-original paint.The rare pigments vivianite and fluorite were identified in a few sixteenth-century works, and along with the more complex mixtures and layer structures compared to earlier works, they contribute to the more nuanced range of colours that distinguishes the later paintings. The most important developments over the period addressed in this article, however, were the introduction of the blue pigment smalt in the sixteenth century, its instability having consequences for the current appearance of paintings from this period, and the green mineral pigment composed of copper sulphate. In earlier works, greens are generally verdigris mixed with yellow pigments, or a blue/yellow mixture such as azurite and lead\u2013tin yellow. These new studies coupled with the scattered occurrences that had already been reported elsewhere make it clear that it was rather common.\nMethods\nOptical microscopy\nOptical microscopy was carried out using a Leica DM4000M microscope and a Zeiss AxioCam HRc camera for recording images. A filter system A (BP 340\u2012380\u00a0nm, dichromatic mirror: 300\u00a0nm, suppression filter: LP 425\u00a0nm) was used for UV excitation.\n\nScanning electron microscopy, coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM\u2013EDX)\nSEM\u2013EDX analysis was carried out using a Carl Zeiss EVO\u00ae MA10 variable pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled to an Oxford Instruments X-Max 80\u00a0mm2 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, using INCA 350 software. The operating parameters were 20\u00a0kV, 200\u00a0pA beam current, approx. 30\u00a0Pa chamber pressure (the minimum necessary to limit charging) with air or water as the chamber gas.\nFor the methodology for quantitative analysis of the colourless glass and smalt under variable pressure conditions, and the accuracy limits see Refs. [8, 45]. Spot measurements were made on several particles in each sample, from which it was possible to assess the consistency of the composition, and to determine whether more than one type of glass was present, or whether there were variations due to differing degrees of leaching. Where all the particles were reasonably homogeneous, the values quoted in the table are an average of the results. In the samples where some of the glass was leached, the composition of the least altered particle is listed, as this will be closest to its original state. For some paintings, the results from different particles could be sorted into distinct compositional groups, each of which is included in the table.\n\nATR-FTIR microspectroscopic imaging\nSpectra were acquired from embedded paint cross-sections using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR Spectrometer connected to a Hyperion 3000 Series microscope, fitted with a 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 (4096\u00a0pixels) FPA detector (range\u00a0=\u00a04500\u2013900\u00a0cm\u22121), cooled with liquid nitrogen. The microscope was fitted with a CCD camera, X\u2013Y stage (adjustment accuracy of 0.1\u00a0\u00b5m) and a dedicated ATR objective (20\u00d7\u00a0magnification). The ATR had a germanium crystal with a tip size of 250\u00a0\u00b5m. Both spectrometer and microscope were purged with water- and CO2-free air. 128 scans were collected at a resolution of 4\u00a0cm\u22121. The 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 pixel focal plane array collects image data from a 32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a032\u00a0\u03bcm square. An effective (diffraction limited) lateral spatial resolution of 3\u20125\u00a0\u03bcm is achieved.\n\n\n              Declarations\n            \nAcknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to colleagues in the National Gallery Scientific Department, David Peggie, and Rachel Morrison, who carried out the ATR-FTIR imaging analyses, as well as to Janet Ambers, British Museum, who conducted the Raman Microscopy.\n\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that she has no competing interests.\n\nAvailability of data and materials\nMost of the data on which the conclusions of the manuscript rely is published in this paper, and the full data is available for consultation on request in the files of the Scientific Department, National Gallery, London.\n\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\n\nFunding\nNot applicable.\n\nPublisher\u2019s Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\n\nOpen AccessThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Kr\u00f8yerPaintingsTube coloursTrade namesPigmentsDyes\nBackgroundPeder Severin Kr\u00f8yer (1851\u20131909), known as P. S. Kr\u00f8yer, is one of the most famous Danish painters, and a central figure in the Nordic artists\u2019 colony established in Skagen at the end of the nineteenth century. Kr\u00f8yer graduated in 1870 from the The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and early in his career he proved to have a unique talent as a portrait painter. His oeuvre counts numerous portrayals of scenes from local life and social gatherings, as well as commissioned portraits of prominent figures in the industry and the cultural life [1\u20133]. The commissioned works, along with his patronage and friendship with the tobacco manufacturer and art collector Heinrich Hirschsprung (1836\u20131908), secured Kr\u00f8yer a considerable income and made him a prosperous painter [1, 2]. With Hirschsprung\u2019s support Kr\u00f8yer was able to make numerous study trips around Europe, which came to be of great influence on his career. In particular the grand tour of 4\u00a0years from 1877 to 1881 marked a turning point in his artistic style and working methods. During this tour Kr\u00f8yer stayed for longer periods in Paris, where he attended classes at the atelier of the French artist L\u00e9on Bonnat (1833\u20131922) [3, 4]. After his return to Denmark Kr\u00f8yer began to spend the summer months working in Skagen, a small fishing village in the northernmost part of Denmark that became a meeting point for Nordic artists during the 1880s [3]. The Skagen painters, as they came to be known, found inspiration in the surrounding nature and local population in Skagen, and benefitted from the social and professional community among the artists. Their motives were most often painted \u201cen plein air\u201d with a clear influence from Naturalism and Realism. Today extensive collections of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s paintings are exhibited at the Art Museums of Skagen, and at The Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen [1, 3]. The latter is also exhibiting Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet.Despite Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s recognition as an artist, very little is known about his painting technique and the artists\u2019 materials he used. Gaining such knowledge is essential in understanding how the works of art were made and how to preserve them in the best possible way. The current study is based on a technical investigation of P. S. Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting technique and artists\u2019 materials, which included an examination of two of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s paintings and the contents of the artist\u2019s painting cabinet. No comprehensive study on this subject has hitherto been carried out, and this is the first paper giving an insight into the tube colours used by Kr\u00f8yer [4]. The analyses were carried out on samples taken from the two paintings as illustrated in Figs.\u00a01 and 2, and on samples taken from the tube colours. Analyses of cross sections of the paint samples were performed by SEM\u2013EDS and Raman spectroscopy in order to obtain information about the pigments used. Samples from the tube colours were analysed by SEM\u2013EDS and Raman for identification of the pigments, and by HPLC for identification of the dyes.\n\nFig.\u00a01\n\nTop P. S. Kr\u00f8yer.

Right detail of signature and dedication in the upper left corner\n\n\nThe two paintings, By the fireside. Portrait of Holger Drachmann with a red fez (hereinafter, Drachmann) and Christoffer mending nets in his living room (hereinafter, Christoffer), were painted by Kr\u00f8yer in Skagen in 1903\u20131907 and 1886 respectively, and hence belong to the latter part of his oeuvre. Drachmann (Fig.\u00a01, top) is one of many portrayals Kr\u00f8yer did of his friend, the Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann (1848\u20131908) [1]. Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s friend and fellow Skagen-painter Michael Ancher (1849\u20131927) depicted Kr\u00f8yer while working on the final stages of the painting (Fig.\u00a01, bottom). It took Kr\u00f8yer 4 years to complete the large portrait, which was unusual given the fact that Kr\u00f8yer was known for his ability to work rapidly. At the time being though, he was struggling with mental illness, and was hospitalised several times [1]. In contrast, the earlier portrait Christoffer from 1886 (Fig.\u00a02, left) is an example of a rapidly executed painting, depicting a local fisherman working in a dark interior. The portrait clearly shows the influence of the realistic model painting and the concept \u201cValeur\u201d, to which Kr\u00f8yer was introduced during his stay at L\u00e9on Bonnat\u2019s atelier. Kr\u00f8yer gave the portrait as a gift to his friend, the French painter Ernest Baillet (1853\u20131902) as evidenced by the inscription in the upper left corner (Fig.\u00a02, right). Both of the paintings are today a part of the collection at The Art Museums of Skagen.The painting cabinet (Fig.\u00a03) has been a fixture in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s ateliers in Copenhagen and Skagen, and it contains, among other things, 32 well preserved tube colours presumably dating from the latter part of the nineteenth century. Today it belongs to the Hirschsprung Collection who received it in 1911 as a gift from Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s estate.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nP. S. Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet.

For ethical reasons samples were only obtained from the tacking edges and from areas with paint losses, hence not all colours could be investigated.

The resin was cured for 10\u00a0min with blue light under a flow of nitrogen gas in a light-curing oven (Egger EL 1 plus N2). Finally the cross sections were polished wet with silicon carbide and then dry with Micro-Mesh (granularity 2400\u201312,000).\n\nOptical microscopy\nThe samples and cross sections were studied with an optical microscope Axio Imager M1 (Carl Zeiss) under polarised white light and ultraviolet radiation with magnifications between 100 and 500\u00d7 and the use of DeltaPix Insight.\n\nRaman\nMRS analyses were carried out with a Renishaw inVia dispersive micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with a 785\u00a0nm laser. The laser power was kept between 0.1 and 1\u00a0mW by neutral density filters to avoid thermal degradation. A detailed description can be found in ref [5].\n\nSEM\u2013EDS\nSEM\u2013EDS analyses were carried out on cross sections and paint samples placed on double sided conductive adhesive carbon tabs using a Hitachi S-3400\u00a0N scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM\u2013EDS) operating at an acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV and low vacuum mode at 25\u00a0Pa. The EDS system, QUANTAX 200, was equipped with two 30\u00a0mm2 SDD X-ray detectors (XFlash\u00ae 6|30 Silicon Drift Detector) from Bruker instruments.\n\nATR-FTIR\nAttenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used as supporting technique. ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR-spectrometer, fitted with a Universal ATR sampling accessory having a one-bounce composite zinc selenide and diamond crystal. Spectra of the samples were recorded over the range 4000\u2013650\u00a0cm\u22121 with a resolution of 4\u00a0cm\u22121 and 4 accumulations.\n\nHPLC\u2013DAD\nHPLC analyses were carried out after mild HF extraction (2\u00a0M aqueous HF/dimethylformamide/acetonitrile\u00a0=\u00a02/1/1). The HPLC\u2013DAD system used for the dye analyses was a Spetra-SYSTEM from ThermoScientific, controlled by ChromQuest 4software. A detailed description can be found in ref [6].\n\nResults and discussion\nPaintings\nThe results from the pigment analysis carried out on samples taken from the two paintings are listed in Table\u00a01. In the table a distinction is made between pigments found in the ground and paint layers, and the two paintings are noted with the letter a or b, designating the portrait of Drachmann and the portrait of Christoffer, respectively.\nBoth paintings were painted on a commercially prepared canvas with a pale white ground containing a mixture of lead white, calcite and silicate. Kr\u00f8yer generally bought his canvases ready-primed [4]. In the case of Christoffer, a canvas stamp from the paint retailer Kultorvets Farvehandel was found on the back of the canvas (Fig.\u00a04, left). The company was established in 1879 at Kultorvet in central Copenhagen, and was run by the founder F. E. K\u00fchle until 1890 when it was taken over by H. Averhoff [7]. A later company label from Averhoff\u2019s time was seen on the stretcher in the portrait of Drachmann (Fig.\u00a04, right), indicating that Kr\u00f8yer could have bought his canvases and stretchers from this particular supplier over a longer period of time.\n\nFig.\u00a04\n\nLeft canvas stamp from Kultorvets Farvehandel (F. E. K\u00fchle) on the back of the portrait of Christoffer. Right label from Kultorvets Farvehandel (H. Averhoff) on the stretcher used for the portrait of Drachmann\n\n\nThe palette used for the two paintings consisted of a mixture of traditional pigments and modern pigments developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. An example was seen in the use of red, orange and yellow pigments in the portrait of Drachmann, where traditional pigments and dyes like vermilion, minium and alizarin were used in combination with modern pigments like chromium orange and cadmium yellow. Vermilion, minium, alizarin, and chromium orange were identified by Raman (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d) [8, 9], while the cadmium sulfide pigments were identified by SEM\u2013EDS. Regarding the green and blue pigments, Kr\u00f8yer seems to have favoured the expensive pigments viridian and cobalt blue, since these were widely represented in the analysed samples from both paintings. An example of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s use of viridian is given in Fig.\u00a06, where a sample taken from the Drachmann portrait is depicted. In polarised light viridian was seen as a deep dark green pigment in the upper paint layer, and in SEM the characteristic irregular rounded shape of the pigment grains was clearly visible [10]. SEM\u2013EDS analysis furthermore showed how the pigment was mixed with barium sulfate, probably in order to make it easier to grind and disperse [10].\n\nFig.\u00a05\nRaman spectra of pigments identified in the two paintings Drachmann (a\u2013d), and Christoffer (e\u2013f). The spectra depicted are a vermilion, b minium, c alizarin, d chromium orange, e ultramarine, and f carbon black. The spectra were assigned by comparison of the spectra to those in the literature [8, 9]\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a06\nDetail of cross section S8 from Drachmann depicted in polarised light (left) and in SEM (right). A green paint layer containing viridian (3) is seen above a white paint layer (2), an isolation layer (1) and a white ground layer (0). In the SEM-image a section of the green paint layer is seen with arrows pointing to the rounded shape of the viridian pigment grains\n\n\nDark blue grains of cobalt blue were likewise consistent in the samples taken from the two paintings. In one of the samples from of the portrait of Christoffer, cobalt blue was found in a mixture with minor amounts of synthetic ultramarine, the latter identified by Raman (Fig.\u00a05e) [11]. The sample was taken from the dark paint layers in the background (S10), and the ultramarine pigment was possibly applied as a substitute for black similar to the practice known from impressionist painters [11]. Kr\u00f8yer did not, however, avoid using regular black pigments, and carbon black was identified in both paintings by its characteristic broad Raman-bands (Fig.\u00a05f) [8].\nThe most notable difference in the palette used for the two paintings was seen in the white pigments. While Kr\u00f8yer used lead white in the portrait of Christoffer, he mainly used zinc white in the later portrait of Drachmann. Zinc oxide was identified in all paint layers in the Drachmann portrait by SEM\u2013EDS, and by optical microscopy due to the pigment\u2019s fluorescence under UV (Fig.\u00a07) [12]. Analyses carried out on two of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s early oil sketches from 1875 and 1876 (not shown) showed that lead white was used in the paint layers in both paintings, while zinc white was not. This seems to suggest that zinc white was introduced on Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s palette somewhere between 1886 where he finished the portrait of Christoffer, and 1903 where he begun painting the Drachmann portrait.\n\nFig.\u00a07\nDetail of cross section S7 from Drachmann depicted in polarised light (left) and in UV light (right). The light blue paint layer (2) above the isolation layer (1) and ground layer (0) contains mainly zinc white and cobalt blue. Due to the presence of zinc white, the paint layer fluoresces when exposed to UV light\n\n\nZinc white has previously been linked to a number of conservation issues due to the pigment\u2019s strong tendency to form zinc carboxylates [13\u201315]. We therefore investigated the formation of zinc soap. By FTIR analysis of samples taken from the Drachmann portrait zinc soap formation as a result from reaction between the oil binder and the zinc oxide pigment was clearly seen (Fig.\u00a08). The stretching vibrations at 2919 and 2850\u00a0cm\u22121, and the bending vibration at 1458\u00a0cm\u22121 are assigned to the long chained CH2 groups, and the vibration at 1739\u00a0cm\u22121 to the C=O stretching from the oil binder. The strong band at 1548\u00a0cm\u22121 and the shoulder at 1593\u00a0cm\u22121 are assigned to asymmetric COO\u2212 stretching vibrations, and the split band around 1412\u00a0cm\u22121 to symmetric COO\u2212 stretching vibrations. Compared to reference spectra for artificially produced zinc carboxylates i.e. zinc stearate, zinc palmitate, and zinc oleate the carboxylate stretchings are shifted towards higher wavenumbers. However, this is often the case for zinc carboxylates formed in actual paint layers where mixtures of both saturated and unsaturated zinc soaps are formed [15].\n\nFig.\u00a08\nFTIR spectrum of a paint sample from the Drachmann portrait identifying zinc carboxylates in the paint layers\n\n\n\nTube colours\nThe vast majority of the tube colours were produced by the Danish colour merchant Vilhelm Pacht, whose colours, among others, were also used by Edvard Munch [16]. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century the tube colours from Vilhelm Pacht were mainly retailed by the large paint shop A. Stelling, established in central Copenhagen in 1860 [7]. Besides from Pacht, Kr\u00f8yer also bought tube colours from the competing Danish colour merchant Hermann Averhoff at the shop Kultorvets Farvehandel, where he also bought canvases (Fig.\u00a04). Only two of the tube colours found in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet were from foreign companies, these being respectively the French Lefranc et Cie and the Italian Felice Alman.\nAn investigation of price lists from Danish nineteenth century paint shops was carried out in the archives of the Royal Library of Denmark. Based on the archival information found on trade names and brands, it seems likely that the majority of the tube colours in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet were bought in the last decade of the nineteenth century or later. The trade names on the tube colours were in most cases written on the label in both Danish and French. While some were rather simple and well-known names like \u201cCadmium yellow\u201d, \u201cChromium yellow\u201d and \u201cCobalt blue\u201d, others like \u201cJaune Brilliant\u201d, \u201cIvory black\u201d and \u201cSnow white\u201d were more fanciful, but still common, examples of trade names used for artists\u2019 colours in the nineteenth century [17\u201319]. Finally there were examples of trade names like \u201cGreen lake light\u201d, \u201cRed oxide\u201d, and \u201cCadmium lemon yellow\u201d, where the results showed no clear correlation between trade name and contents.\nAn overview of the results from the analysis carried out on the contents of the tube colours is presented in Table\u00a03. In many cases the trade name on the label proved to correspond to the pigment(s) found in the tube colour. An example was the analysis of the tube colour named \u201cChromium yellow light\u201d, where Raman identified chrome yellow as the primary pigment (Fig.\u00a09a) [8, 9]. The small band seen at 1054\u00a0cm\u22121 in the Raman spectrum can be assigned to the presence of lead carbonate or basic lead carbonate [9], which suggests that lead white was added to the colour in order to obtain a lighter shade of yellow. This, however, appears to be unusual since lead sulfate has traditionally been the most common addition to colours based on chrome yellow [20]. The tube colour containing chrome yellow and the tube colour labelled \u201cCadmium lemon yellow\u201d which contained the extremely rare cadmium chromate pigment [21], were the only two tube colours where chromate pigments were found. All the remaining yellow tube colours were cadmium sulfide based colours. To what extent Kr\u00f8yer has used chromate pigments is unclear based on the two paintings analysed. Chromium orange, PbCrO4\u00b7PbO, was found in three samples from the Drachmann portrait (S2, S3 and S5), but a tube colour containing this pigment was not present in the painting cabinet. Thus, more paintings have to be investigated in order to find out, which role chromate pigments played in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s palette. The instability of the chromate pigments was already in the nineteenth century well known among artists [22\u201324], which makes it a possibility that Kr\u00f8yer deliberately avoided using them to a greater extent in his paintings.Table\u00a03\nPigments, fillers and dyes identified in the tube colours by Raman, SEM\u2013EDS, and HPLC\nTrade name (Brand)Nos.Raman/SEM\u2013EDSHPLCCadmium yellow dark (Pacht)2CdS orange\u00a0Cadmium yellow light (Pacht)2CdS yellow\u00a0Brilliant yellow (Pacht)2CdS yellow, ZnO\u00a0Cadmium lemon yellow (Pacht)1KCd2(CrO4)2(H3O2)\u00a0Chromium yellow light (Pacht)1PbCrO4, Pb3(CO3)(OH)2\n\u00a0Viridian (Pacht)2Cr2O3\u00b72H2O, Al2O3\n\u00a0Viridian* (Pacht)2Cr2O3\u00b72H2O, BaSO4, Si, carbon black\u00a0Chrome green light (Pacht)1Cr2O3\u00b72H2O, CdS, ZnO, BaSO4\n\u00a0Chrome green medium (Pacht)1Cr2O3\u00b72H2O, CdS, KZn2(CrO4)2(H3O2), ZnO, BaSO4\n\u00a0Cobalt blue (Pacht)2CoAl2O4\u00b7Al2O3\n\u00a0Ivory black (Pacht)3C,Ca5(PO4)3(OH)\u00a0Snow white* (Pacht)1ZnO, carbon black\u00a0Green lake light (Averhoff)1Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, BaSO4, AlNaphthol yellow S, auramin O, martius yellowMadder lake golden rose (Pacht)1CaCO3, Mg3Si4O10(OH)2, Al, PPurpurin, pseudopurpurinMadder lake deep rose (Pacht)2CaCO3, BaSO4, Al, PPurpurin, alizarinMadder lake rose (Alman)1Al, P, S, SnPurpurinCarmine lake ordinary (Lefranc)1CaCO3, Al, SnCarminic acidRed oxide (Pacht)1CdS orange, AlPurpurin, alizarinRed oxide (Averhoff)1Fe2O3, BaSO4, Al, PNot analysedRed oxide (Averhoff)4CdS orange, Al, PNot analysed\n* Designates tubes described as \u201cslowly drying\u201d on the label\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a09\nRaman spectra of pigments identified in the tube colours.

The spectra were assigned by comparison of the spectra to those in the literature [8, 9]. The peaks in b arising from the organic dyes has not been assigned\n\n\nIn relation to the stability of chromate pigments the analysis of the two tube colours labelled \u201cChrome green light\u201d and \u201cChrome green medium\u201d should be noticed. The name \u201cChrome green\u201d has typically been used for the mixture of chrome yellow and Prussian blue [20, 25], but in this case the tubes contained a mixture of viridian, zinc yellow, cadmium sulfide and barium sulfate. It seems very likely, that the manufacturer changed the composition of the colour in order to create an alternative to the traditional \u201cChrome green\u201d based on more durable pigments. Similar examples have been reported by Townsend et al. [26]. In general durability seems to have been an important matter to Danish colour merchants in the end of the nineteenth century. The tube colours from Vilhelm Pacht were ranked in the price lists (Table\u00a02) as being either completely durable (HH), durable (H) or uncertain (without a letter).\nAmong the 32 tube colours in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet, 6 tubes contained lake pigments indicated by their trade names. One tube labelled \u201cGreen lake light\u201d showed a surprising result, whereas the remaining five tubes with trade names for various shades of red madder and carmine contained the expected dyes based on their names and the artists\u2019 materials available in this period.\nThe single tube colour labelled \u201cGreen lake light\u201d contained a mixture of yellow dyes precipitated on aluminium and barium sulfate containing substrate, and a blue pigment identified as Prussian blue (Fig.\u00a09b) by Raman analysis (2155, 2092, 538, and 278\u00a0cm\u22121) [8]. By HPLC the yellow dyes were identified as Naphthol yellow S together with a smaller amount of Auramin O and Martius yellow (Fig.\u00a010a). Naphthol yellow S precipitated on aluminium and barium sulfate was found to be similar to a synthetic Indian yellow prepared by Winsor and Newton (reference sample archived at Laboratories of IRPA/KIK since the 1950s), hence the \u201cGreen lake light\u201d could be described as a mixture of Prussian blue and synthetic Indian yellow.\n\nFig.\u00a010\nHPLC chromatograms of the tube colours a: \u201cGreen lake light\u201d (350\u00a0nm), b: \u201cMadder lake deep rose\u201d (495\u00a0nm), and c: \u201cCarmine lake ordinary\u201d (495\u00a0nm). Peak identification is inserted\n\n\nFour tube colours had trade names for variant shades of red madder i.e. \u201cMadder lake golden rose\u201d, \u201cMadder lake deep rose\u201d, and \u201cMadder lake rose\u201d. In the first mentioned HPLC-analysis identified the organic colourants to be purpurin and pseudopurpurin, which could be interpreted as Kopp\u2019s purpurin [27] precipitated onto a substrate containing calcite and talc. Purpurin and alizarin were identified in the latter two, confirming a madder-based product best described as garancine [27, 28]. In the tube labelled \u201cCarmine lake ordinary\u201d, carminic acid was identified (Fig.\u00a010c) showing that this lake was actually prepared from cochineal insect [29]. Together with carminic acid, another unknown red dye compound was found, which perhaps indicates the extraction method of cochineal, but its significance is unclear.\nSix tube colours, one from Vilhelm Pacht and five from Hermann Averhoff, were all labelled \u201cRed oxide\u201d. Despite having identical trade names and almost identical colours, the analysis showed a considerably variation in the contents of the tubes. Only one of the five tube colours from Averhoff was found to contain hematite as the main pigment as expected by the trade name (Fig.\u00a09c). The remaining four all contained cadmium sulfide, and hence showed a discrepancy between trade name and contents. In addition all five tube colours contained red lakes based on the identification of typical mordants Al, P, and Sn [28, 30, 31]. The \u201cRed oxide\u201d from Pacht likewise contained a mixture of cadmium sulfide and a red lake identified by Raman as alizarin (Fig.\u00a09d) and by HPLC as purpurin and alizarin (not shown).\nThe cases of the \u201cGreen lake light\u201d and the \u201cRed oxide\u201d are just a few examples of the complexity that relates to artists\u2019 colours from the 19th century [26]. A clear correlation between trade name and contents is not always seen, and consequently artists have often not had a sound knowledge of the colours they used.\n\nRelation between the analysed paintings and tube colours\nGiven the fact, that most of the tube colours in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet were probably bought in the last decades of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s life, it seemed reasonable to draw a line between the tube colours and the paintings from the latter part of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s career. Especially the large portrait of Drachmann, finished only 2 years before Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s death in 1909, seemed to be closely linked to the tube colours found in the artist\u2019s painting cabinet. Cadmium sulfide pigments, viridian, cobalt blue and zinc white were all examples of pigments found in both Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s portrait of Drachmann and in a number of his tube colours.\nZinc white appears to have been an important part of Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s palette in the latter part of his career [4, 32]. In the analysed samples from the Drachmann portrait, zinc white was present in all paint layers where it was applied in mixtures with a wide variety of other pigments. Moreover the colour \u201cSnow white\u201d containing zinc white pigment was the only white tube colour present in the painting cabinet. A part from the pure white tube colour, zinc white was only identified in one other tube colour, this being \u201cJaune brilliant\u201d where it was mixed with cadmium sulfide. It thus looks as if Kr\u00f8yer himself intentionally blended zinc white into his colours on the palette in order to lighten the variant shades, as zinc white was present in all areas of the portrait of Drachmann.\nSome pigments like chromium yellow and cadmium chromate [21] were only found in the tube colours. It is uncertain to what extent Kr\u00f8yer has actually used these pigments in his paintings. Further analyses of other paintings by the artist could possibly provide information with regard to this question. In contrast the pigments vermilion, minium and chromium orange were all identified in the Drachmann portrait, whereas they were not present in any of the tube colours in the painting cabinet. This emphasises that conclusions about an artist\u2019s painting materials cannot be drawn based on access to the materials alone without including analyses of the paintings themselves.\n\nConclusionsThe analyses carried out on the samples from the two paintings and the tube colours have given an insight in the painting materials used by Kr\u00f8yer in the latter part of his career, e.g. the pigments applied on his palette, and his favourite brand in tube colours and colour merchants. In general Kr\u00f8yer used the commercially produced artists\u2019 materials that became available from colourmen during the nineteenth century. The canvases were bought ready grounded, either on the stretcher or by the metre, and the composition of the ground consisted of lead white, calcite and silicate. Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s palette consisted of both traditional pigments and modern ones developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, among these, several pigments containing chromium, cadmium and cobalt. In general the pigments found in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s paintings and tube colours were expensive reflecting that Kr\u00f8yer was a well-established and wealthy artist, who did not have to choose the cheaper alternatives. A noticeable change in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s palette seems to have taken place somewhere in between 1886 and 1903, where lead white was replaced with zinc white.The tube colours found in Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s painting cabinet were primarily from Danish colour merchants, with the majority from the colour manufacturer Vilhelm Pacht. Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s tube colours had trade names typical for artists\u2019 paints used during that period of time. In most cases the pigment(s) found in the tubes matched what would be expected based on the trade name. However, notable exceptions were found, such as the rare cadmium chromate pigment present in the tube colour \u201cCadmium lemon yellow\u201d [21], as well as the \u201cGreen lake light\u201d and \u201cRed oxides\u201d described above. This illustrates that it was not always obvious to artists what they bought from their colour merchant. The fact that some pigments were found in the paintings, but not in any of the tube colours in the painting cabinet and vice versa, emphasises that conclusions about an artist\u2019s painting materials cannot be drawn based on access to the materials alone without including analyses of the paintings themselves.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors contributed to data interpretation and to finalizing the manuscript.

Non-contact scientific examination may enable the identification of an artist\u2019s materials and offers insight into the construction of an object without affecting its integrity. The information obtained expands knowledge about the production technology and visual appearance of the artwork, and the artist\u2019s working methods. Precise and complete digital archival images also provide a definitive record of the object at the time of acquisition. If the resolution is high enough, the digital record also constitutes a means for the documentation and accessibility of CH [1\u20133]. For all of these purposes, accuracy and high quality are important aspects of the data acquired. Records should be true representations of the original artwork, without anything added or taken away.Acquisition of digital images and associated data serves as a good basis for repeatable research, across both time and place of different institutions, allowing the exchange and safe, non-destructive analysis of obtained results. Digital techniques enable a better and more precise description of all parameters during the acquisition and subsequent processing, including calibration and correction. Applications of spectral image acquisition systems include: imaging in broad bands by multispectral systems; quantification of reflectance spectra at each point by hyperspectral systems; recording of a data cube enabling the reconstruction of images (visible RGB, infrared, greyscale), and statistical processing for mapping, land usage, crop distributions, etc. Many types of spectral image acquisition systems have been applied for the study and digital documentation of cultural heritage artworks. Depending on the device and workflow, however, the results obtained may vary considerably in quality.Colour and Space in Cultural Heritage (http://www.COSCH.info) was a European network of researchers, conservators and museum professionals, supported by the COST programme. This 4-year trans-domain Action (TD1201, 2013\u20132016) explored high-resolution optical techniques, defining good practice and open standards for digitisation and documentation of cultural objects. It was focused especially on practitioners of heritage science, i.e. technical staff with high levels of expertise in laboratories and university research facilities, who were associated with national museums.The primary objective of COSCH Working Group 1 (WG1) was the \u201cidentification, characterisation and testing of spectral imaging techniques in the visible and near infrared field\u201d. In this context, a Round Robin Test (RRT) exercise was conducted to compare the characteristics and performance of different spectral imaging systems. Five test objects were analysed at 21 institutions, each with its own instrumentation and workflow. This article is focused on one of the RRT objects by qualitative comparison of the spectral imaging data obtained from ten different imaging systems. The multiple datasets were compared through visual inspection of both global and local areas, and the effectiveness of each system for dealing with this type of object was subjectively assessed. In addition, a reconstruction of the reflectance spectrum at selected points was undertaken. Although several systems in the complete RRT recorded infrared spectral reflectance of up to 2500\u00a0nm, the ten systems reported in this article were limited to the visible and near infrared ranges, with a maximum wavelength of 1000\u00a0nm.\nTest object: a Russian iconOne of the RRT objects, the subject of this article, was a polychrome Russian icon from the late 19th century. Icons constitute a form of religious art, with stylised sacred images of saints, Christ and the Virgin Mary, in which the figures often appear timeless and static against golden backgrounds. The COSCH test object, hereafter described as the Russian icon, is cuboidal with dimensions 267\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0222\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a023\u00a0mm. It was purchased through eBay in January 2014 from a dealer in Tallinn, Estonia. It depicts the traditional subject \u201cVirgin of Kazan\u201d but is printed by chromolithography, not painted by hand, onto a substrate of tinned steel. It gives the impression of the lid of an old biscuit tin, which has been nailed around the edges onto a wooden support. The surface is slightly convex, and its condition is marred by many tiny spots of rust on the underlying steel showing through the printed pattern. The icon was manufactured in Moscow in 1899 by the firm Zhako and Bonaker, whose speciality was making containers for shoe polish. The owners had invited master-painters from Mstera, a village in Vladimir Province, who were experts in the ancient techniques and styles of icon painting, to produce new designs. This capitalistic approach to mass-production had an adverse effect on the craft and artistry of icon painting, but the iconographic motifs, combined with surrogate gold (samovarnogo) and false jewels, made an indelible impression on the mass public, who purchased the products in their millions [4] (Fig.\u00a01).\n\nFig.\u00a01\nPhotograph of the Russian icon, manufactured in 1899 by the firm Zhako and Bonaker (Moscow), taken by a Nikon D200 camera on a copystand under tungsten illumination\n(for which see Fig.\u00a013)\n\nThe Russian icon was chosen as a test object for the study because of its particular physical and material characteristics. Instead of a matte finish, it has a medium gloss on the painted areas and a shiny metallic finish on the gold. There is a wide range of tones and colours, including skin tones and a pictorial realism to the figures, which make it suitable for image quality assessment. The fine spatial detail in both the half-tone colour separations and the filigree gold decoration are appropriate for testing the optical resolving power of an imaging system. The surface is flat, almost planar, with virtually no 3D relief, and it has a convenient size and format. Because it is a common mass-produced object, rather than a fragile artwork, it can be handled freely by researchers in the laboratory without gloves. It turned out to be a very demanding test object, revealing several critical aspects of system performance.\nSpectral reflectance image captureSpectral imaging systems, which scan the entire surface of an artwork without physical contact, enable spectroscopic information to be obtained as an accurate digital record. They have increasingly been included in the range of analytical techniques available for the conservation and study of CH [5\u20138]. Spectral imaging devices acquire images in many different wavebands, enabling the reflectance spectrum to be sampled at each pixel and hence the colorimetric representation of the image to be calculated for any specified spectrum of visible illumination. Note that in this study we are dealing with multi/hyperspectral imaging based on directional or diffuse reflectance of illumination from a surface as a function of wavelength. As an image acquisition modality, this is distinct from X-ray fluorescence scanning to obtain an XRF spectrum at every single point on an object, which could also be claimed as a type of hyperspectral imaging.An imaging system is commonly considered to be multispectral if the number of spectral bands is greater than 3 and less than 20, for which the working bandwidth is between 10 and 50\u00a0nm. In turn, systems with hundreds of contiguous bands with a bandwidth less than 5\u00a0nm are considered hyperspectral [9]. The definitions of multispectral and hyperspectral are very author-dependent. Goetz argues that the term multispectral should be used if no contiguous bands are acquired, irrespective of the range of spectral sensitivity of the equipment, while hyperspectral should apply if contiguous bands are acquired [10]. With this definition in mind, all of the equipment used in the present study may be considered as hyperspectral, some limited to the visible range and others covering the Visible\u00a0+\u00a0NIR range. Recently the new term ultraspectral has been proposed for systems where there are thousands of bands with a bandwidth of as little as 0.1\u00a0nm [11].All these image acquisition devices generate datasets with three dimensions (two spatial and one spectral), commonly represented as a data-cube [12]. Their performance, however, is dependent on the many components of the imaging system, including illumination, optics, filters, dispersive gratings, sensor and signal processing, and also on operator choices relating to object positioning, calibration, file format and metadata [13]. Usually, each institution has its own unique set-up and specific workflow, which are dependent on the working principles of the acquiring system, and hence can significantly affect the information acquired for the same object [14]. As an example, the standard procedure in the National Museum in Krakow, Poland, involves a series of tasks requiring manual adjustment and judgement, as follows:a.\nAs there is no set working distance, first the area to be scanned is defined, bearing in mind that the larger the frame the coarser the spatial sampling.\n\u00a0b.\nFocusing of the optics to obtain a sharp image.\n\u00a0c.\nPlacement of lights, setting the proper distance and angle (usually 45\u00b0).\n\u00a0d.\nSetting exposure level to obtain maximum signal strength without over-exposure.\n\u00a0e.\nRegulating movement speed of the camera stage to achieve true 1:1 geometric scale.\n\u00a0f.\nAdjusting frame rate and sampling time for data acquisition.\n\u00a0g.\nRecording the image.\n\u00a0h.\nRecording data for image normalisation: white target scan and dark image scan.\n\u00a0i.\nApplying a normalisation algorithm to the image data.\n\u00a0j.\nImage data is saved in a standard format.\n\u00a0k.\nEntry of metadata relating to image.\n\u00a0\nThis specificity not only makes it difficult to compare data from different systems, as it can influence the accuracy and reliability of the recorded information, but also causes some systems to be inappropriate for particular objects. Spectral imaging as a method of documentary recording of cultural artefacts would be much more useful if standardised procedures could be established for a wide range of systems, users and materials.Various earlier projects have contributed to the development of spectral imaging technology for the CH sector and have succeeded in designing high-performance hardware and software solutions for accurate image acquisition and processing. These commenced in the early 1990s with the VASARI project at The National Gallery, London, which achieved accurate high-resolution colorimetric images of paintings using a multispectral scanning system with seven filters in the visible region [15, 16]. The CRISATEL project later extended the work into the NIR region and applied basic spectroscopy techniques to the results [17]. Advances in technology made hyperspectral imaging possible in the 2000s [18]. The use of \u2018pushbroom\u2019 techniques was pioneered by IFAC-CNR in Florence [19, 20] and by the National Gallery of Art in Washington [21]. Simple photographic methods with transmission filters applied to either the camera or the illumination remain viable, however, and may be considered as the technological baseline against which more sophisticated systems can be compared [22].Recent applications of hyperspectral imaging in cultural heritage include two Italian illuminated manuscripts, where the characteristics of the spectral reflectance signal in the visible range were used to identify pigments by comparing the obtained spectra with those of a reference library of medieval pigments [23]. In another study, the analytical suitability of two different hyperspectral imaging systems was evaluated for Goya\u2019s paintings, the first employing a \u201cpush-broom\u201d system and the second a \u201cmirror-scanning\u201d system. The main pigments present were identified by imaging reflection spectroscopy [24].\nQualitative assessment of image qualityThe research question within the present study was: to what extent do the operating principles and technologies of a range of spectral image capture systems affect the image quality achieved in the datasets?Spectral image quality is influenced by a number of factors [25] and understanding their role and how different devices are used in the digital documentation workflow will help to define better procedures for acquisition and processing. Spectral image recording systems are first and foremost imaging devices, and so can be compared against the performance of more familiar digital cameras and scanners. The quality of the images acquired can be assessed by the well-established methods of visual scaling and psychophysics, with observers judging each image either in isolation or side-by-side with a reference image [26]. Various attributes of image quality can be distinguished and scaled, including tonal rendering, colour, sharpness, naturalness, freedom from defects, etc.Image datasets from ten different systems were compared (Table\u00a01). Four were pushbroom hyperspectral devices, three were multispectral systems based on liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF), and three were Nikon cameras with external narrow-band transmission filters. The illumination system was different in each case. The institution in Spain carried out measurements with two different systems (D and J). Datasets from France, Italy, Poland and Cyprus were shared as file-cubes. All the others were provided as sets of single TIFF images or as Matlab data files. Because some systems are commercially available while others are custom-built and upgradable and flexible, it is difficult to compare them directly by specification. Nevertheless, the available information about the type of system, working bandwidth and spatial resolution is summarised in Table\u00a01. The spatial resolution is calculated as the number of pixels across the width of the icon in the digitised image, divided by its physical width of 222\u00a0mm.Table\u00a01\nParticipating institutions and characteristics of their systems\nImageCountrySystemRange (nm)# BandsWorking bandwidth (nm)Illumination sourceSystemCamera informationSpatial resolution (pixels/mm)ANorwayLCTF400\u20137203310Fluorescent lampsCustom builtDVC-16000\u00a0M monochrome 4872\u00a0\u00d7\u00a032486.0BFrancePushbroom414\u20139941603.5Tungsten halogen 150\u00a0W fibre opticHyspex VNIR1600SSI CCD 1600\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012008.1CCyprusFilters420\u201310003020Two 50\u00a0W halogen lights (4700\u00a0K)MuSIS HSCCD and photocathode 1600\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012005.2DSpainPushbroom400\u201310006110D65\u2014SpectraLight III luminaireCustom builtMonochrome CCD 1392\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104012.0EPolandPushbroom394\u20131009776<1OSRAM Decostar WFL 12\u00a0V 35\u00a0WSpecim V10EMonochrome sCMOS linear 2184 pixels5.5FItalyPushbroom398\u2013961448<1Two fibre-optic Schott 150\u00a0WCustom builtMonochrome CCD 1344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010242.2GPortugalLCTF400\u20137203310Metal Halide\u2014Sylvania 150\u00a0WCustom builtMonochrome CCD 1024\u00a0\u00d7\u00a013444.1HUKFilters400\u20137001620Photolux 150\u00a0W tungsten halogenCustom builtNikon D200RGB CCD3900\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0260010.4JSpainLCTF400\u20137203310VeriVide Daylight FluorescentCustom builtMonochrome CCD 1392\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010404.9KSwitzerlandFilters420\u20136601320Two Broncolour flashlightsCustom builtNikon D3RGB CMOS4256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0283210.2\nColour images were initially reconstructed from each dataset using the ENVI 4.7 software. The three wavebands nearest to 605, 530 and 450\u00a0nm were chosen for the red, green and blue (RGB) channels respectively to produce a \u2018false colour\u2019 image. Even though the responsivities of these channels are dependent on their bandwidths and peak wavelength, and are not equivalent to the spectral sensitivities of the eye\u2019s photoreceptors nor to the primaries of the sRGB standard display [27], they offered a convenient means for qualitative comparison between the disparate imaging systems. Given sufficient time and resources, alternative methods would have been: (a) to make a weighted sum of the spectral bands to approximate the display RGB primaries; or (b) to reconstruct the visible reflectance spectrum for each pixel and then to calculate the sRGB image via the CIE tristimulus values (see Fig.\u00a09 below).A group of ten observers, five male and five female, with ages ranging from 20 to 50, all with normal colour vision, was chosen. They were asked to evaluate the quality of each of the ten reconstructed RGB images using a five-step psychometric (Likert-type) scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), for each of the following parameters: uniformity of illumination, contrast, sharpness, geometric distortion, visibility of fine spatial details, and colour fidelity. The participants were also asked whether they saw any defects in each image, and to evaluate the overall quality of the images on a five-step scale from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good). Finally, they were asked to rank the ten images from most preferred to least preferred. As a reference image, the reconstructed RGB image from the dataset from Norway was chosen, as it was considered to lie somewhere between the best and worst images of the whole set. When shown to the observers, each of the other nine test images was displayed alongside the reference image (Fig.\u00a02). It would have been preferable to have judged the images against the actual icon, viewed under controlled illumination, but at the time of the experiment it was elsewhere being digitised.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nRGB images of the Russian icon reconstructed from datasets of Norway (A) and France (B). The visual assessment always used the same image on the left as reference in a pair comparison technique\n\nThe diversity of imaging technologies from the different institutions created considerably different visual results, with varying degrees of pleasantness (Figs.\u00a02, 3, 4). The acceptability of the icon images was judged individually by ten observers, viewing them on an uncalibrated LCD display screen of diagonal 27 inches from a distance of approximately 1\u00a0m. The display white point was set to D65 with a luminance of 180\u00a0cd/m2, and judgements were made under typical office illumination (combination of overhead fluorescent lights and daylight from west-facing windows). Each of the test images was compared side-by-side with the same reference image (Fig.\u00a02A). It was not always a simple task to assess the differences between the images because in some cases they appeared dramatically different. Uneven illumination in some systems had caused shading effects and over-exposed areas due to specularity. Some images had been cropped to different sizes and/or geometrically distorted, and varying resolution affected the definition of fine details.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nRGB images of the Russian icon reconstructed from the datasets of: Cyprus (C), Spain (D), Poland (E) and Italy (F)\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a04\nRGB images of the Russian icon from the datasets of: Portugal (G), UK (H), Spain (J) and Switzerland (K)\n\nThe following results emerged from the observer judgements:\nA, C, H and J were considered the worst images in terms of uniformity of illumination, while B, F and G were considered the best;\n\nB and K were considered the sharpest images, while J did not enable discrimination of fine details;\n\nD and J were geometrically distorted (both skew and cropping);\n\nF and G were considered the worst images in terms of colour reproduction;\n\nB and K were the most preferred images, while J was the least acceptable.\n\nThe representation of image detail was assessed by enlarging a small square region of the image around the central jewel in the Virgin\u2019s necklace, corresponding to an area of 10\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm on the icon surface. Because of the differing spatial resolution of the systems (Table\u00a01), these details ranged in size from 22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a022 to 120\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0120 pixels, but to enable fair comparison all have been enlarged to the same size (Fig.\u00a05). The variety of rendering of detail, as well as tone and colour, across the different systems is remarkable. It should be noted that the apparent sharpness of image detail depends not only on sampling resolution (pixels/mm) but also on the point spread function (focus) of the optics and registration of the images in the three colour channels.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nDetail of the central jewel in the Virgin\u2019s necklace from the ten reconstructed images of (left to right): Norway (a), France (b), Cyprus (c), Spain (d), Poland (e), Italy (f), Portugal (g), UK (h), Spain (j) and Switzerland (k)\n\n\nSpectral reconstructionA quantitative analysis was performed for the three hyperspectral datasets from France, Italy, and Poland, which were compared with the multispectral data from UK. Six points on the icon were selected (Fig.\u00a06) and the data vector was extracted from the corresponding pixels in each channel of each image using ENVI 4.7 software.\n\nFig.\u00a06\nReconstructed RGB image of the Russian icon (from dataset of France), showing the different locations from which spectral reflectance was sampled: 1 skin; 2 red robe; 3 blue vest; 4 green shirt; 5 brown shadow; 6 yellow robe; 7 gold\n\nThe spectral reflectance distribution of the object at each point should ideally be independent of the characteristics of the imaging system and illumination and observer. To provide the \u2018ground truth\u2019 for reference, spot measurements were made at the six positions shown in Fig.\u00a06 using a hand-held X-rite i1Pro spectrophotometer. This instrument is designed for quality control of glossy prints in the graphic arts, so has 45/0 geometry, i.e. it illuminates the surface at an angle of 45\u00b0 and senses the light reflected perpendicular to the surface, in order to avoid specular reflections. The light is averaged over the area of the surface covered by a circular aperture of 4.5\u00a0mm diameter. The reflectance factor is reported at 10\u00a0nm intervals over the range 380\u2013730\u00a0nm, with results shown in Fig.\u00a07. The spectra for all colours are quite broad and smoothly changing. The gold was also measured, and was surprisingly low in reflectance factor because its lustre was excluded by the measurement geometry. It was not possible to measure the white or turquoise paints because nowhere on the surface was there an area large enough to span the instrument\u2019s aperture.\n\nFig.\u00a07\nReflectance spectra measured by spectrophotometer at seven points on icon surface\n\nThe reflectance spectrum at each location of multispectral dataset H was estimated by averaging a square region of 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030 pixels in each of the 16 spectral channels, processing the image data in Matlab. As the image resolution was approximately 10 pixels/mm, this corresponds to a region of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm on the icon surface. The raw images from the camera (in NEF format) were converted to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016-bit RGB TIFF files by the utility DCRAW, to ensure tonal linearity of the data. Corresponding values were obtained for both the icon and a matte grey card used as the reference, and the reflectance factor \\(R\\) at each wavelength was calculated as:$$R\\left( {\\lambda_{k} } \\right) = G\\left( {\\lambda_{k} } \\right)\\left( {i\\left( {\\lambda_{k} } \\right) - b} \\right)/ \\left( {g\\left( {\\lambda_{k} } \\right) - b} \\right)$$where filter \\(k\\) (range 1\u201316) corresponds to peak wavelength \\(\\lambda_{k} = 400, 420, 440 \\ldots700\\)\u00a0nm; \\(G\\) is the reflectance factor of the grey card, measured by the spectrophotometer; \\(i\\) is the mean pixel value of the icon image in the sample area; \\(g\\) is the mean pixel value of the grey card image in the sample area; \\(b\\) is the mean pixel value of the black image in the sample area.All images were taken in a dark room to minimise the ambient light. The grey card was placed in the plane of the top surface of the icon, covering the same area, and served to correct both non-uniformity of illumination across the surface of the object and vignetting of the lens. The black image was taken with the grey card in place but the copystand lights off, and was an average of ten successive image frames, to reduce the effects of noise. The blue camera channel was used for \\(k\\) in the range 1\u20136 (filter wavelengths 400\u2013500\u00a0nm), the green channel for \\(k\\) in the range 7\u201310 (520\u2013580\u00a0nm), and the red channel for \\(k\\) in the range 11\u201316 (600\u2013700\u00a0nm). The end values at 400 and 700\u00a0nm were unreliable because of the very low signal level through the filters. The resulting reflectance factors are plotted in Fig.\u00a08 as a function of wavelength against the reference measurements from the spectrophotometer for three sample points.\n\nFig.\u00a08\nReconstructed vs measured reflectance spectra for three sample points: (left) green shirt; (centre) yellow robe; (right) red robe. In the legend \u2018eye one\u2019 means the X-rite i1Pro spectrophotometer, used to measure surface reflectance factor\n\nThe same calculation was applied to every pixel in the image and the resulting reflectance factors interpolated to 5\u00a0nm intervals over the range 400\u2013700\u00a0nm. Tristimulus values were calculated by multiplying the reflectance factor at each pixel by the spectral power distribution of the D65 illuminant and the responsivity functions of the CIE Standard Observer. The resulting image was converted to the sRGB display colour space [27], giving the result in Fig.\u00a09.\n\nFig.\u00a09\nColorimetric image reconstructed from dataset H under D65 illuminant\n\nComparison with the conventional RGB photograph from the same Nikon D200 camera (Fig.\u00a01) shows that the computed colorimetric image is lower in contrast and colour saturation, but is a good match in hue. Comparison with the \u2018rough and ready\u2019 RGB image synthesised from three bands of the multispectral image set (Fig.\u00a04H) shows a great improvement in overall colour balance, but a loss of sharpness because of uncorrected chromatic aberration.The three hyperspectral systems from France (B), Poland (E) and Italy (F) all used a Spectralon tile as the white reference. Comparison of their reflectance spectra reconstructed at six sample points of the images (Fig.\u00a010), reveals that they are in general agreement, with similar shapes of the curves and inflections at the same wavelengths. The differences in amplitude are indicative of how each individual imaging geometry reacted differently to the non-Lambertian surface of the icon.\n\nFig.\u00a010\nReflectance spectra from six different locations of the Russian icon, Reconstructed from the datasets of: France (B), Poland (E), Italy (F) and UK (H), with the reference data of a spectrophotometer (S)\n\nAnalysis of the spectra in Fig.\u00a010 enabled a quantitative assessment, by comparing the reconstructed spectra of the four systems with the reference spectrophotometer data. Using the Matlab function interp1, all spectra were interpolated to 1\u00a0nm intervals in the range of the visible spectrum from 400 to 700\u00a0nm, and differences were calculated between corresponding points in terms of both root-mean-square error (RMSE) and colour difference (\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\)). The latter is the Euclidean distance between two stimuli expressed in the CIE L*a*b* colour space, and is scaled so that one unit of \\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\) corresponds approximately to one just-noticeable difference (JND) [28]. For colour photography and print reproduction, values of \\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\) less than 5 would generally be considered acceptable [29]. The results in Table\u00a02 show the target colour in CIELAB coordinates (referred to the D65 illuminant) of each of the seven sample points in Fig.\u00a06 and the corresponding differences for the four systems. In most cases the RMSE errors were less than 0.02 and colour errors were less than 5 \\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\) although larger values occurred for the red robe and gold sample points.Table\u00a02\nColour coordinates of the sample points and analysis of errors between reconstruction and spectrophotometer reference data\n\u00a0Red-robeYellow-robeGreen-shirtBlue-vestBrown-shadowSkinGold\nL*\n37.3454.2151.5337.1321.2461.6733.50\na*\n46.0222.72\u221222.68\u221220.9017.7219.113.46\nb*\n16.2151.2120.92\u221223.4513.8634.3020.44\nFrance\nRMSE0.03760.01080.00730.01080.00510.01510.0742\n\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\)\n4.534.793.133.632.123.1214.91\nItaly\nRMSE0.04570.01600.00770.00730.00680.01030.0238\n\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\)\n5.561.902.862.622.791.846.82\nPoland\nRMSE0.05480.01420.00940.00590.00850.02130.0370\n\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\)\n5.883.593.601.516.332.197.71\nUK\nRMSE0.02360.01100.01090.01540.00680.01850.0287\n\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\)\n11.050.984.644.131.932.927.41\nThe results agree with analysis of two hyperspectral systems for another of the RRT test objects, the X-rite colour checker chart [30]. There it was found that in CIE L*a*b* coordinates the patches presenting larger colour differences were magenta, blue and red (\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\) values of 3.7, 3.8 and 5.1 respectively), which lie at the ends of the visible range where the reflectance spectra also exhibited greater variations. On the other hand, the green and yellow patches were more similar between the two systems (\\(\\Delta E_{ab}^{*}\\) values of 3.3 and 2.5).One notable difference between the hyperspectral datasets is the amount of noise present in the signal, especially at the ends of the range. As an example, Fig.\u00a011 shows an enlarged section of the reflectance spectra from the three systems plotted in Fig.\u00a010 for the skin sample between 400 and 450\u00a0nm. There is evidently much more \u2018jitter\u2019 in system E than in the other two, especially at the shortest wavelengths, because there is some inherently greater perturbation from one wavelength to the next. The sensitivity of silicon sensors at around 400\u00a0nm is very low, resulting in visible image noise. The difference in noise levels is a function of the camera electronics, physical pixel size, whether an equalisation filter has been used and whether noise reduction processing (such as averaging) has been carried out.\n\nFig.\u00a011\nDetails of three hyperspectral reflectance spectra of skin for short wavelengths 400\u2013450\u00a0nm\n\nSignificant differences between the systems were found for the gold area sampled at the location shown in Fig.\u00a06. Although the reflectance spectra all have the same shape, with the characteristic upward slope to a peak at around 610\u00a0nm, they vary in amplitude by factors of as much as 3\u00d7, both greater and less than the reference measurement of the spectrophotometer (Fig.\u00a012), which leads to the large errors in Table\u00a02. This arises from both the granular nature of the surface and the breadth of the specular peak that gives gold its characteristic lustre [31], causing the image intensity detected by each system to be critically dependent on its illumination geometry.\n\nFig.\u00a012\nReflectance spectra of gold, relative to spectrophotometer measurement (S)\n\nAn interactive visualisation of high-resolution hyperspectral data from the Russian icon has been developed and can be viewed online [32]. This facility uses the IIPImage software suite [33] to provide interactive online access to a subset of the hyperspectral data. It features an image stack including a colorimetric CIE L*a*b* rendering of dataset B under a D65 illuminant and single frames at various specific wavelengths, which the user can select and smoothly blend between.\nDiscussionThe purpose of this study was to compare the datasets acquired by different imaging systems, in order to assess the impact of the setup and workflow of each device on the results obtained. In particular, we investigated the capabilities of ten multispectral and hyperspectral devices to digitise a polychrome nineteenth-century Russian icon with a glossy surface, high specularity and very fine spatial details. We found that the systems and workflows employed by the participating institutions varied widely, including cameras, light sources, imaging geometry and file formats. The cost of the different devices used in the RRT ranged from a few thousand euros, such as for the filter-based photographic systems used by Institutions H and K (Table\u00a01), up to 50 thousand euros for some of the specialised hyperspectral imaging systems. All these factors were largely responsible for the wide variations in image quality that were observed. One of the difficulties encountered was the insufficient or, in some cases the complete lack of, written documentation of the procedures employed to produce the image files. Metadata is directly associated with most of the steps in an imaging system workflow and makes possible the identification, management, access, use, and preservation of the digital images. However, it can be time-consuming to produce and is often neglected.The reflectance factor recorded at each point of the object surface may vary for each instrument or sensor according to its calibration and imaging geometry, i.e. the relative angles of the illumination and optical axis with respect to the tangent plane at the surface. The imaging geometry can have a dramatic effect on glossy surfaces, and for best results it is essential to have some flexibility in the positioning of the light source(s) and object relative to the camera, thereby enabling the operator to exercise judgement in the setup. While this is easily achieved by traditional means in a photographic studio (Fig.\u00a013), it requires careful opto-mechanical design for integrated scanning devices.\n\nFig.\u00a013\nMultispectral imaging of the Russian icon on a photographic copystand. The Nikon camera is fixed vertically above the object, with four tungsten-halogen lamps arranged symmetrically on either side, at a low angle of elevation to minimise specular reflection\n\nThe hyperspectral imaging instrument at IFAC-CNR is a good example of state-of-the-art spectral imaging with illumination geometry equivalent to that of a spectrophotometer [34]. The system is based on a prism line-spectrograph, connected to a high sensitivity CCD camera. The line-segment is illuminated by two fibre-optic line-lights equipped with focusing lenses fixed to the scan-head, which project their beams symmetrically at angles of 45\u00b0 with respect to the normal direction of the imaged surface (0\u00b0/2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a045\u00b0 observation/illumination geometry). The distance of the lens from the object surface is approximately 20\u00a0cm. The assembly of lights and spectral head move together during the scanning in order to illuminate only the small rectangular area under acquisition (Fig.\u00a014). The combination of high scan rate and small area of illumination ensures that the overall light exposure levels are compatible with the recommended limits in museums.\n\nFig.\u00a014\nHyperspectral imaging of the Russian icon on a system designed by IFAC-CNR in Italy. The assembly of camera and dual lighting moves vertically in front of the stationary object\n\nDuring the RRT the Russian icon circulated among 21 institutions around Europe with the other COSCH test objects. The working conditions and technical parameters of the acquisition process were not specified. Each institution was asked to image the icon with the setup and methods routinely applied in its own laboratory, including everything from the physical support of the object to the setup of the camera and illumination to the processing of the image. Each group was also asked to provide, together with the image data, a description of the system, setup and procedure used for the acquisition. What was provided in many cases, however, was incomplete metadata, with limited or no information regarding the illumination, calibration, normalisation, and processing details, which made it difficult to interpret the image data. In general it needed to be explained more clearly by each provider of a spectral dataset what corrections, if any, had already been applied to the image data.This study showed that the data obtained from spectral imaging systems is critically dependent on methodological procedures and that it can vary considerably across laboratories implementing different practices. Some harmonisation is therefore desirable to allow proper comparison, adequate use and efficient communication. In every case, image data should be complemented with detailed metadata to enable correct application by users. Both \u2018raw\u2019 and \u2018corrected\u2019 image data should be provided for each object, the latter compensated for degradations related to the image acquisition process, e.g. spatial and spectral calibration, defocus, noise, among others. Specifications regarding the light source are possibly the most important. Its spectral power distribution and spatial variation should be measured and recorded and taken into account in data processing.The correction of spatial non-uniformity of illumination should be implemented and/or specified using images of a uniform card (normally but not necessarily white) for each spectral band. The noise level should also be estimated by imaging with the system using the same physical setup but optically occluded. Some systems have a significant degree of scattered light and its magnitude should be estimated. Chromatic aberrations should be avoided as much as possible as they introduce wavelength-dependent image distortions that are difficult to correct by post-processing, i.e. variable misregistration and defocusing in different spectral bands. Using apochromatic optics will minimize the associated problems. The effects of the non-uniform spectral sensitivity of the sensor and its impact on signal-to-noise ratio should be taken into account. Data from the camera manufacturer or in-house calibration can be used to compensate for this effect. If the system employs different exposure times for different wavelengths this should be specified. We suggest that the image processing procedures should include \u2018sanity checks\u2019 at key points along the processing chain, for example to check on the tonal linearity of the data by using a neutral scale with multiple shades of grey from black to white, and to compare the reconstructed reflectance spectra against spectrophotometer reference measurements, including colorimetric measures.\nConclusionsThe ability to digitise and reproduce images of the Russian icon as a truthful representation of the real object proved to be difficult, and significantly different results were obtained from the ten systems and workflows tested. The acceptability of the visual quality of the reproductions was judged by a panel of observers. Obviously, this was a qualitative and subjective assessment, and the difficulty of identifying which image is more realistic limits the value of the results for purposes of examination and documentation. This is particularly true when dealing with coloured artworks or pigmented materials that need to be reproduced with high accuracy.It must be noted that perceived colour is not simply a property of coloured objects, which could be regarded more as modifiers of the incident light than as themselves the sources of colour. Colour is dependent not only on the reflectance of the object, but also on the properties of the light striking its surface, and the visual sensitivity and adaptation of the observer, all of which are functions of wavelength. Consequently, the retention of descriptive data about the conditions used during acquisition and subsequent data processing should be of great importance. In our case, however, the recording of metadata was generally found to have been neglected, which made the assessment and comparison of some datasets very difficult or even impossible.The results of the RRT showed a considerable variability in the image data, caused by the diversity of devices (multi- and hyper-spectral systems), their measurement geometries, the methods of data processing, the personnel operating the imaging systems, and the guiding purpose for application of these devices by the different groups (colour reproduction, documentation, identification of materials, etc.). All these factors resulted in varying levels of quality in the final spectral datasets.The obtained results emphasise the necessity of defining standardised methodologies and best practices for different imaging systems. Specifically, we draw attention to the importance of calibration (spectral, radiometric and spatial) procedures and knowledge of the intrinsic accuracy, precision and limits of the technologies. Furthermore, the RRT made clear the need for regular calibration, validation and testing of every system.Given the difficulties and ambiguities encountered in this study, it is clear that considerable further refinement of systems and standardisation will be required before multispectral and hyperspectral imaging can be widely adopted within the heritage science community. In the development of standards, the criteria and technical requirements for spectral imaging systems might differ, depending on whether digital documentation or scientific analysis of materials (or both) are considered. It would be advantageous also to consider developments relating to colour management in the graphic arts and media industries, in particular the new iccMAX specification that is currently being adopted as an international standard [35]. This defines a spectral profile together with a spectral profile connection space (PCS), based upon spectral representation of colour rather than colorimetry, as the basis of encoding surface reflectance and hence of colour communication.In the COSCH RRT, each institution was asked to follow its own practices and to produce a good quality result. Yet the datasets exhibited a wide range of image quality attributes. Much has been made in the discussion above about the need for a standardised procedure, but the fact is that today there exists no such standard. In order to achieve a standard whereby different institutions could achieve consistent results with different optomechanical systems, the imaging geometry, in particular, would have to be closely specified and controlled, analogous to the standards for instrumental spot colour measurement [36].A new emerging standard, ISO 19263-1, intended for imaging of two-dimensional originals by cultural heritage institutions, specifies a method for analysing imaging systems where it is important to control the degree of accuracy and to ensure that imaging quality is maintained over time [37]. Three aspects of imaging system performance are covered: (a) evaluation\u2014for system benchmarking; (b) optimization\u2014for tailoring the system to a particular job (use case); and (c) monitoring\u2014for controlling the quality of the system to remain within specified limits. ISO 19263-1 can be used to establish and maintain image quality in digitisation workflows, and to develop a digitisation strategy including assessment of collections and system selection. Such standards will be essential for generating meaningful digital datasets that can be interpreted and repurposed for many diverse applications.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsThe contributions of the authors were as follows: LM supervised the study and the writing of the article and gathered and analysed the multispectral data in his lab in London; TV performed the experiment in London and wrote the technical report upon which this article is based; MP led the whole RRT exercise and took a leading role in the assessment of the RRT data; RP collected and analysed hyperspectral image data in his lab in France; MO and JS collected and analysed hyperspectral image data in their lab in Poland; SN and JL contributed to the overall design of the RRT, and collected and analysed hyperspectral image data in their lab in Portugal.

The monument was occupied by Khmer Rouge since 1989 and released in 1998. The maintenance of the monument was conducted by the Cambodian Government during 2000\u20132002. The monument was designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 2008.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nLocation of the representative Khmer monuments, including the Preah Vihear monument [1]. The provenance of sandstones used for constructing the Khmer monuments is also shown in this figure [2, 3]. The colored asterisks for each monument are correlated with the various sandstone formations used to construct them\n\nThe study of the Preah Vihear monument was initiated by Barth [4] and Bergaigne [5] and then followed by Aymonier [6], Lunet de Lajonquiere [7], Groslier [8], Parmentier [9], C\u0153d\u00e8s [10], Jacques and Freeman [11], and Sahai [12]. These studies were conducted from architectural and art-historical viewpoints or based on inscriptions. The Preah Vihear monument is believed to have been constructed by the Khmer people between the 9th and 12th century AD. Groslier [8] and Parmentier [9] considered that the Preah Vihear monument consisted originally of wooden buildings and they were later replaced by masonry buildings.Parmentier [9] and Sahai [12] created construction chronology of the Preah Vihear monument based on architectural evidences and inscriptions, respectively. The construction chronology inferred by them is based on unclear architectural traces and limited inscriptions, leaving room to be reconsidered. In contrast to the previous studies, this study infers objectively the construction sequence of the monument based on its building stone characteristics such as the chemical composition, magnetic susceptibility, and size of the sandstone blocks, taking into account architectural, iconographic and epigraphic evidences.\nBuildings in the Preah Vihear monumentThe Preah Vihear temple faces north and is located on a slope of the Dangrek Range that increases in altitude from the north entrance (550\u00a0m above sea level) to the southernmost end (630\u00a0m above sea level), with a relative height of 500\u00a0m above the plain of Cambodia. The Preah Vihear temple is a horizontally\u2013oriented layout temple on terraced slope as well as the Wat Phu temple in Laos. The distance between the north entrance and the south end is approximately 800\u00a0m.The buildings of the Preah Vihear monument are arranged in four groupings (Fig.\u00a02). The names and symbols used to identify its constituent buildings are from Roveda [13]. The southernmost group is the largest, and consists of the South Gopura (A) (Fig.\u00a03a), Central Sanctuary (B), Mandapa (C), Gallery (D) (Fig.\u00a03a), Western Building (E), Eastern Building (F), Gopura I (G), Libraries (H1 and H2) (Fig.\u00a03b), Hall (J), L-shaped Galleries (K1 and K2), and Gopura II (L). Relatively large sandstone blocks were used in the South Gopura (A), Central Sanctuary (B), Eastern Building (F), part of the Gallery (D), and part of the Western Building (E). In addition, bedrock was used for part of the Gallery (D) and Western Building (E).\n\nFig.\u00a02\nPlan view of the Preah Vihear monument [13], showing the name and symbol of each building. The five construction stages established in this study based on sandstone characteristics and pediment end style are shown as different colors, grading from blue to red, corresponding to oldest to newest edifices. Arrows indicate the construction sequence with respect to adjacent buildings\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a03\nPhotographs of (a) South Gopura (A) and Gallery (D), (b) Eastern Library (H1), (c) Gopura III (P), (d) Gopura IV (T), (e) ancient sandstone quarry for large sandstone blocks situated in the south of South Gopura (A), and (f) ancient sandstone quarry situated in the west of the causeway between Gopura IV (T) and Gopura V (W). Sandstone blocks used for these building have a yellowish-brown color\n\nThe second group from the south is the second largest, and consists of the Annex Halls (N1 and N2) and U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2) and Gopura III (P) (Fig.\u00a03c). Bedrock was used for part of the platform of the Western Annex Hall (N2). A small Tower (Q) is located north of the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1). The third group consists only of the Gopura IV (T) (Fig.\u00a03d), and the fourth group only of the Gopura V (W). The upper structure of the Gopura V (W) has almost collapsed.\nMethodsMagnetic susceptibility of the sandstone blocks was measured using a portable magnetic susceptibility meter (ZH instruments SM30, Brno, Czech Republic), with a reading surface of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0cm. Measurements were made on 50 flat surfaces in each section of each building of the monument, and used to calculate average values. Care was taken to avoid blocks covered with algae or lichen [14, 15].Chemical analyses of the sandstone blocks were carried out using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer (pXRF; Innov-X Systems Delta Premium, Waltham, MA, USA), measuring in soil mode. The instrument was calibrated using 10 reference rocks from the Geological Society of Japan (JA-1, JA-2, JB-1b, JB-2, JB-3, JG-1a, JG-2, JGb-1, JR-1, and JR-2) [16]. Measurement time was 1\u00a0min. Measurements for five sandstone blocks in each building were obtained from flat surfaces, not covered by algae or lichen. These values were averaged.The size of the sandstone blocks was determined along wall surfaces, showing width and thickness. Dimensions were measured for 25\u201350 sandstone blocks in each section of each building of the monument, and averaged. In addition, bedding plane orientations in the sandstone blocks were recorded.Three different types of pediment end styles were recognized in the Preah Vihear monument. We investigated the pediment end style in each building to clarify the relationship with the construction period.\nResultsThe results of magnetic susceptibility and pXRF measurements are summarized in Table\u00a01, along with information on block size and pediment end style. Variation in these parameters within the monument is discussed below. The construction sequence (the first to fifth stages) listed in Table\u00a01, but described in more detail later, is inferred from the chemical composition, magnetic susceptibility, sandstone block size, pediment end style, and the presence or absence of relief work on the tympana of the adjacent buildings.Table\u00a01\nConstruction sequence for buildings of the Preah Vihar monument based on

width, and large:\u00a0>50\u00a0cm thickness or\u00a0>100\u00a0cm width (on average)\n\n\nMagnetic susceptibility\nThe siliceous sandstone blocks used in the Preah Vihear monument have low magnetic susceptibilities, with average values in the range of 0.011\u20130.068\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units. In contrast, the gray to yellowish-brown sandstones used in the Angkor monuments, which are feldspathic arenites supplied from the southeastern foot of Mt. Kulen, have higher average magnetic susceptibilities, with values in the range of 0.7\u20139.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units [14, 15, 17, 18].\nThe sandstone blocks of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) (the first stage) have the lowest magnetic susceptibility in the Preah Vihear monument, averaging 0.011\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units. The magnetic susceptibility of the sandstone blocks of buildings in the second stage is high, averaging between 0.041 and 0.047\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units. It is low in the third stage, with averages in the range of 0.023\u20130.045\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units. The Mandapa (C), Gopura I (G), Hall (J), Gopura II (L), and Gopura III (P) edifices belonging to the fourth stage have the highest values, with averages in the range of 0.049\u20130.068\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units. The fifth stage buildings have low magnetic susceptibilities, with averages in the range of 0.019\u20130.042\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units.\n\nChemical composition\nThe following elements were quantitatively measured using the pXRF: K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Pb. Among these elements, K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr show systematic changes in content in the sandstone blocks used during construction. The contents of K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr in the sandstone blocks are relatively low in the first and third stages, but high in the second and fourth stages. They have intermediate values in the fifth stage.\nIn particular, the contents of Rb and Ti changed markedly. In the first and third stage edifices, their contents had ranges of 20\u201330\u00a0and 1050\u20131100, and 22\u201328 and 800\u20131000\u00a0ppm, respectively. Their contents were higher in the second stage (33\u201345 and 1240\u20131510\u00a0ppm) and the fourth stage (37\u201344 and 1330\u20131480\u00a0ppm). The fifth stage had the low to intermediate contents (18\u201334 and 1000\u20131360\u00a0ppm).\n\nBlock size\nIn Table\u00a01, block size is listed as: \u201cSmall\u201d,\u00a0<50\u00a0cm in thickness and\u00a0<50\u00a0cm in width; \u201cMedium\u201d,\u00a0<50\u00a0cm in thickness and 50\u2013100\u00a0cm in width; and \u201cLarge\u201d,\u00a0>50\u00a0cm in thickness or\u00a0>100\u00a0cm in width. Table\u00a01 shows that block size became larger over the construction time.\nThe central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2), in contrast to other parts or other buildings, was constructed with the smallest sandstone blocks in the Preah Vihear monument, having an average thickness and width of 35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a043\u00a0cm. Likewise, the sandstone blocks used in the platform of the Western Annex Hall (N2) are distinctly thin, having a thickness and width of 23\u00a0\u00d7\u00a044\u00a0cm on average. In contrast, large sandstone blocks with dimensions of 60\u201380\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0130\u2013160\u00a0cm or larger were used in the Central Sanctuary (B), South Gopura (A), Eastern Building (F), Gopura IV (T), part of the Gallery (D), and part of the Western Building (E). Medium-sized sandstone blocks were used in all other buildings.\n\nBedding plane orientations\nIn the upper structure of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2), 54% of sandstone blocks have vertical bedding planes. Many sandstone blocks with square ends are also observed in the platforms of the Eastern Annex Hall (N1) and U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2), and almost half of them have vertical bedding planes. Similarly, sandstone blocks with square ends are frequently observed in the Gopura V (W) and Gopura IV (T), and almost half of them have vertical bedding planes. In contrast, the large sandstone blocks used in the Central Sanctuary (B), South Gopura (A), Gallery (D), and Eastern Building (F) have mainly horizontal bedding planes. Sandstone blocks with face bedding are also observed in the South Gopura (A) and Gallery (D). In the remaining buildings, horizontally-elongated sandstone blocks, with high width/thickness ratios and primarily horizontal bedding planes, were used.\n\nPediment end styles\nPreah Vihear monument building pediment ends have two styles, based on their terminations (Fig.\u00a04). One style of a pediment ends in scrolls. Such pediments also are observed in Preah Ko, Koh Ker, and Banteay Srei of the early Angkor period (the end of the 9th century to the mid-10th century). The other style ends in five-headed nagas (Fig.\u00a04f). These pediments are observed in a wide range of periods, from the Banteay Srei style period to the Bayon style period in the middle to late Angkor period (the mid-10th century to the early 13th century). The scroll\u2013style pediment ends can be subdivided into pediments that end in scrolls made from one block (Fig.\u00a04a) and those that end in scrolls made from two blocks (Fig.\u00a04b, c, e), yielding three distinct pediment end styles. The pediments ending in scrolls made from two blocks are likely to be of a later style because they are not found in relatively older monuments such as Preah Ko, Koh Ker and Banteay Srei. The Annex Halls (N1 andN2), U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2), Gopura III (P), and Gopura V (W) have pediments that end in scrolls made from one block; while the Gopura II (L), Gopura I (G), Hall (J), Galleries II (K1 and K2), Western Building (E), and Eastern Building (F) have pediments that end in scrolls made from two blocks. The South Gopura (A), Mandapa (C), Gallery (D), Libraries (H1 and H2), and Gopura IV (T) have pediments that end in five-headed nagas.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nImages showing pediment end styles at the Preah Vihear monument. a A pediment ending in scrolls made from one block [Gopura III (P)], (b) a pediment ending in scrolls made from two blocks [Gopura II (L)], (c) a pediment ending in scrolls made from two blocks [Western L-shaped Gallery (K2)], (d) a mortise of a pediment ending in scrolls made from two blocks [Western L-shaped Gallery (K2)], (e) a stone block with a tenon that fell from a pediment ending in scrolls made from two blocks [Western L-shaped Gallery (K2)], and (f) a pediment ending in five-headed nagas [Gallery (D)]\n\n\n\nInterpretation and discussion\nOrigin of sandstone\nThe sandstone used in the Preah Vihear monument is siliceous sandstone (quartz arenite) and clearly different from the gray to yellowish-brown sandstone (feldspathic arenite) used in the Angkor monuments [17]. This siliceous sandstone of the early Cretaceous age is found within the Khorat Plateau and Mt. Kulen regions (Fig.\u00a01) [19]. In the Angkor monuments, red siliceous sandstone blocks were uniquely used for Banteay Srei. For most of the rest of the Angkor monuments, the Red Terrain Formation (called the Phu Kradung Formation in Thailand) of the late Jurassic to the early Cretaceous supplied the gray to yellowish-brown sandstone. The Red Terrain Formation is overlain conformably by the Upper Sandstone Formation, which consists of siliceous sandstone of the early Cretaceous age [19]. The gray to yellowish-brown sandstone outcrops at the foot of the Khorat Plateau and Mt. Kulen, but was not used in the monuments on the Khorat Plateau. In Thailand, the Upper Sandstone Formation is subdivided into three units, from bottom to top, these are the Preah Vihear (Phra Wihan), Sao Khua, and Phu Phan Formations. These formations are not homogeneous and vary in color. The Preah Vihear Formation is mainly yellowish-brown, with fine to coarse grain size, and magnetic susceptibilities of less than 0.068\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units (0.020\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units on average) [1]. The Sao Khua Formation is primarily red, with fine to medium grain size, and magnetic susceptibilities of 0.016\u20130.086\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units (0.040\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units on average). The Phu Phan Formation is white, with medium to coarse grain size, and magnetic susceptibilities of less than 0.030\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units (0.008\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units on average). Magnetic susceptibilities are highest for the Sao Khua Formation and lowest for the Phu Phan Formation, with the Preah Vihear Formation magnetic susceptibilities falling in the middle [1].\nThe sandstone used in the Preah Vihear monument is mainly yellowish-brown (Fig.\u00a03), and is medium to coarse grained. All the sandstone blocks of the Preah Vihear monument have magnetic susceptibility ranging from 0.011 to 0.068\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 SI units, which is consistent with their supply from the Preah Vihear Formation. This accounts for the abundant ancient sandstone quarries widely distributed around the Preah Vihear monument, especially in the eastern and western areas, along the causeway between the Gopura IV(T) and Gopura V(W) (Fig.\u00a03e, f).\nExcept for the Libraries (H1 and H2) had higher Sr contents of 58 and 56\u00a0ppm, respectively, the Sr contents in sandstone blocks from the other buildings were less than 30\u00a0ppm. According to Uchida et al. [1], the Sr content of the Preah Vihear Formation sandstone is typically less than 40\u00a0ppm. This also supports the premise that the sandstone blocks used in the Preah Vihear monument were quarried from the Preah Vihear Formation.\n\nConstruction chronological sequence\nUsing results described above, we delineated five construction stages for the Preah Vihear monument, as described below (Table\u00a01; Fig.\u00a02). In particular, the Ti and Rb contents, magnetic susceptibility, and size of the sandstone blocks, pediment end style, as well as the presence or absence of relief work on the tympana of the adjacent buildings were important factors for determining these stage divisions (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nFig.\u00a05\nPlot showing the average Ti contents vs average magnetic susceptibilities for sandstone blocks used in construction of the Preah Vihear monument. Data given in Table\u00a01. Values are clearly characteristic of different stages of construction\n\n\nWe believe that the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) was constructed first (Fig.\u00a06). The sandstone blocks in the upper structure of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) are markedly smaller than those in the eastern and western parts of this Western Annex Hall (N2), as well as all other buildings in the monument. Their size is similar to sandstone blocks used in the sanctuaries of Phnom Krom and Phnom Bok of the Angkor area, constructed in the Bakheng style period (the end of the 9th century to the beginning of the 10th century). The sandstone blocks used in the platforms of Phnom Krom and Phnom Bok also are thin (20\u201325\u00a0\u00d7\u00a035\u201345\u00a0cm) compared with those used in their sanctuaries [20]. This block style also occurs in the platform of the Western Annex Hall (N2). In addition, the magnetic susceptibilities of the sandstone blocks in the upper structure of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) are the lowest of any of the Preah Vihear monument. Furthermore, 54% of the sandstone blocks of the upper structure of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) have vertical bedding planes. This arrangement of blocks suggests that the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) was constructed in or before the Angkor Wat style period (before the end of the 12th century) [21]. Thus, the sandstone blocks and their arrangement in the upper structure of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) are markedly different from those of the other parts of the Western Annex Hall (N2) and the other buildings. Their characteristics suggest that the upper structure of the central part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) was constructed in the Bakheng style period (the end of 9th century to the beginning of the 10th century). The platform of the central and western parts and the lower platform of the eastern part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) were likely constructed during the same period (Fig.\u00a06), given that their sandstone blocks have similarly low magnetic susceptibilities.\n\nFig.\u00a06\nPhotograph of the southern face of the Western Annex Hall (N2) showing sections constructed during various stages. The central part (the platform and upper structure), the lower platform of the eastern part, and the platform of the western part were constructed first (first stage); the upper structure and upper platform of the eastern part followed (second stage); and finally, the upper structure of the western part was constructed (third stage)\n\n\nGiven that the tympana of the U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2) adjacent to the Annex Halls (N1 and N2) are undecorated, but the other tympana are decorated, we concluded that the U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2) were constructed later than the Annex Halls (N1 and N2). Among these buildings, the Eastern Annex Hall (N1), Western U-shaped Extension (O2) and the eastern part (the upper structure and the upper platform) of the Western Annex Hall (N2) were constructed during the second stage. Pediments that end in scrolls made from one block are found in all these buildings. The sandstone blocks used in these buildings are relatively rich in K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr. Although the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1) has pediments that end in scrolls made from one block, its sandstone blocks have different chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities from those of the Eastern Annex Hall (N1), Western U-shaped Extension (O2), and the eastern part of the Western Annex Hall (N2). Therefore, the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1) likely belongs to the third stage of construction. The sandstone blocks in the upper structure of the eastern part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) have similar chemical compositions to those in the Eastern Annex Hall (N1)\u00a0and Western U-shaped Extension (O2). This suggests that the upper structure of the eastern part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) was extended while construction of the Eastern Annex Hall (N1) and Western U-shaped Extension (O2) was undertaken. The sandstone blocks in the upper structure of the western part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) have similar chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities to those of the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1). This suggests that the upper structure of the western part of the Western Annex Hall (N2) was extended during the third stage, clearly later than the eastern part (second stage).\nGiven the similarity in style of the Eastern Annex Hall (N1) to the Khleang temple in the Angkor area, we believe that the second construction stage corresponds to the Khleang style period (the mid-10th century to the mid-11th century). The Eastern Annex Hall (N1) has an inscription (K381), which describes an event that took place in AD 1024 [10] or AD 1026 [12]. This suggests that the Eastern Annex Hall (N1) and Western U-shaped Extension (O2) were completed around AD 1024 or AD 1026.\nThe Gopura V (W) was also likely constructed during the third stage, because its sandstone blocks have similar chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities to those of the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1), and it has pediments that end in scrolls made from one block. The sandstone blocks used in the upper structure of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) are also similar in chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities to those of the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1), suggesting that the upper structure of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) was constructed in this third stage. However, the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) has pediments that end in scrolls made from two blocks, which are different from those in the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1). Given the chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities of its constituent blocks, we consider the possibility that the platform of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) was constructed using the same sandstone blocks as those used in second-stage buildings. This is supported by the fact that the sandstone blocks of the third stage have distinctly lower K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr contents and magnetic susceptibilities than those of the second stage.\nWe infer that the Gopura III (P) was constructed after the U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2) because reliefs were carved on the tympana of the U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2), but were left unfinished on those of the Gopura III (P) adjacent to the U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2). In addition to the Gopura III (P), Gopura II (L), Hall (J), Gopura I (G), Mandapa (C), and Eastern L-shaped Gallery (K1) were constructed in the fourth stage, characterized by sandstone blocks with relatively high K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr contents and magnetic susceptibilities. Medium-sized sandstone blocks were used in all of these buildings, except for the Gopura III (P). The Gopura III (P) has pediments that end in scrolls made from one block, while the Mandapa (C) has pediments that end in five-headed nagas. The other buildings have pediments that end in scrolls made from two blocks. Judging from the pediment end style, construction of the Gopura I (G), Hall (J), Gopura II (L), and Eastern L-shaped Gallery (K1), and then Mandapa (C) may have followed the construction of the Gopura III (P).\nThe sandstone blocks of the Gopura II (L) are similar in chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities to those of the Eastern L-shaped Gallery (K1), but differ from those of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2). This suggests that the Eastern L-shaped Gallery (K1) was constructed at a different time to the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) (during the second to third stages). The style of the pediment ends suggests that the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) was constructed after the Gopura III (P). However, the construction sequence inferred from the style of the pediment ends contradicts that derived from the chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities of their sandstone blocks.\nThe inscription (K380) on the door frame of the Gopura II (L) consists of three sets of texts written in AD 1037\u20131038, AD 1038, and AD 1049, which describes events from AD 1018 [10\u201312]. This suggests that the Gopura II (L) was constructed at the end of the Khleang style period (the mid-11th century). Therefore, the buildings in the fourth stage are estimated to have been constructed from the end of the Khleang style to the Baphuon style (the mid-11th century to the end of 11th century) periods.\nThe remaining buildings at the site belong to the fifth stage. The sandstone blocks of these buildings have lower magnetic susceptibilities than those belonging to the second and fourth stages, and their chemical contents of K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr fall between those of the second and fourth stages, and those of the third stage (Fig.\u00a05).\nThe Western and Eastern Buildings (E and F) have pediments that end in scrolls made from two blocks; thus, we infer their construction slightly before the Central Sanctuary (B), Gallery (D), South Gopura (A), Gopura IV (T), and Libraries (H1 and H2), which all have pediments that end in five-headed nagas. We believe that the Gopura IV (T) was constructed first among these buildings, because its sandstone blocks have square ends and almost\u00a0 half of them have vertical bedding planes, which are frequently seen in the platform.\nIn contrast to the other buildings, the sandstone blocks of the Libraries (H1 and H2) are uniformly high in Sr and have similar magnetic susceptibilities to each other. This suggests that the Libraries (H1 and H2) were constructed at the same time. Given the site layout, we infer that the Libraries (H1 and H2) were constructed after the Gopura I (G), Hall (J), Gopura II (L), and Galleries (K1 and K2). This is supported by the fact that the Libraries (H1 and H2) have pediments that end in five-headed nagas, whereas the buildings surrounding the Libraries (H1 and H2) have pediments that end in scrolls made from two blocks. Decoration also is more elaborate on the Libraries (H1 and H2), as well as on the Mandapa (C) and Hall (J), compared with other buildings in this stage.\nThe large sandstone blocks of the South Gopura (A), Central Sanctuary (B), Gallery (D), and Tower (Q) have similar chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities. In addition, these buildings, except for the Tower (Q), have pediments that end in five-headed nagas. Given these facts, we infer that these buildings were constructed at nearly the same time. Because the Tower (Q) has no decoration and is unfinished, it may have been the last construction undertaken in the Preah Vihear monument. Because large sandstone blocks were used, with bedding planes that are mainly horizontal [21], the South Gopura (A), Central Sanctuary (B), and Gallery (D) are consistent with the Angkor Wat style period (the end of the 11th century to the end of the 12th century). In contrast, the Eastern Building (F), Western Building (E), Gopura IV (T), and Libraries (H1 and H1) belong to the Baphuon style period (the mid-11th century to the end of the 11th century), and were constructed before the South Gopura (A), Central Sanctuary (B), and Gallery (D), based on their sandstone characteristics.\nFor comparison, the construction sequences for the Preah Vihear monument previously inferred by Parmentier [9] and Sahai [12] are outlined in Table\u00a02. Parmentier [9] used an architectural viewpoint, while Sahai [8] used inscriptions to establish a sequence. The sequence obtained in this study differs considerably from those obtained by both Parmentier [9] and Sahai [12]. Based on its sandstone block characteristics, we concluded that the Western Annex Hall (N2) is the oldest edifice in the Preah Vihear monument. This is not consistent with the construction sequences proposed by Parmentier [9] or Sahai [12]. They did not recognized that the Western Annex Hall (N2) was the oldest building in the construction sequence of the Preah Vihear monument. However, we support their inference that the Eastern Annex Hall (N1) and U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2) were constructed in the late Khleang style. Both authors considered that the Mandapa (C), Gopura I (G), Hall (J), and Gopura II (L) were constructed before the Annex Halls (N1 and N2) and U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2). The South Gopura (A) and Gallery (D) also were inferred to be older than the Annex Halls (N1 and N2) and U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2) in their studies, being different from this study. Meanwhile, all studies support that the Gopura III (P) was constructed later than the Annex Halls (N1 and N2) and U-shaped Extensions (O1 and O2). We concluded that the Gopura III (P), Gopura II (L), Hall (J), Gopura I (G), and Mandapa (C) were constructed during the same period (in late Khleang style to the Baphuon style (the beginning of the 11th century to the end of the 11th century) based on their similar sandstone block chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities.Table 2\nComparison of the constructions sequences for the Preah Vihear monument proposed by Parmantier [9], Sahai [12] and this study\n\n\n\n\nAll three studies agree that the Central Sanctuary (B) was constructed in the final stage. However, Parmentier [9] and Sahai [12] considered the South Gopura (A) and Gallery (D) surrounding the Central Sanctuary (B) to have been constructed during the same period as the Mandapa (C). However, we found their sandstone block characteristics to be distinctly different. Large sandstone blocks were used in the South Gopura (A) and part of the Gallery (D) as well as in the Central Sanctuary (B), in contrast to the Mandapa (C). In addition, the sandstone blocks of the South Gopura (A) and Gallery (D) are different in chemical compositions and magnetic susceptibilities from those of the Mandapa (C), but similar to those of the Central Sanctuary (B). Given these facts, it is difficult to accept the construction sequences for these buildings proposed by either Parmentier [9] or Sahai [12].\n\nConclusionsUsing sandstone block chemical and magnetic characteristics, as well as stone arrangement and decoration, a construction sequence for the buildings in the Preah Vihear monument was established comprising five stages. The buildings and their distinctive stone characteristics are outlined below in order of their construction:First stage (the Bakheng style period:the end of the 9th century to the beginning of the 10th century): initial construction of the upper structure of the central part and platform of the Western Annex Hall (N2) took place to form the oldest edifice in the Preah Vihear monument. The sandstone blocks in this stage are characterized by low magnetic susceptibilities, small block size, with a high percentage of vertical bedding planes. The stone block characteristics of the Western Annex Hall (N2) are completely different from the other buildings in the Preah Vihear monument. Previous works by Parmantier [9] and Sahai [12] did not recognized that this building was the oldest one in the construction sequence of the Preah Vihear monument.Second stage (the middle Khleang style period:the early 11th century): ongoing construction of the upper structure of the eastern part of the Western Annex Hall (N2), Eastern Annex Hall (N1) (around AD 1024 or AD 1026), Western U-shaped Extension (O2), and the platform of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) took place. The sandstone blocks used in this second stage are relatively enriched in K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr and have high magnetic susceptibilities.Third stage (the late Khleang style period:the early 11th century to the mid-11th century): construction of the upper structure of the western part of the Western Annex Hall (N2), Eastern U-shaped Extension (O1), the upper structure of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2), and Gopura V (W) took place. All buildings, except for the Western L-shaped Gallery (K2) constructed during the second and third stages, have pediments that end in scrolls made from one block. The sandstone blocks in the third stage are relatively depleted in K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr. They also have low magnetic susceptibilities.Fourth stage (the end of the Khleang style period to the Baphuon style period:the mid-11th century to the end of the 11th century): construction of the Gopura III (P), Eastern L-shaped Gallery (K1), Gopura II (L) (around AD 1038 or AD 1049), Hall (J), Gopura I (G), and Mandapa (C) took place. The sandstone blocks used for these buildings are characterized by high magnetic susceptibilities and high K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr contents. The pediment terminations changed from scrolls to five-headed nagas.Fifth stage (the Baphuon style period to the Angkor Wat style period:the mid-11th century to the end of the 12th century): construction of the Western Building (E), Eastern Building (F), Gopura IV (T), Libraries (H1 and H2), South Gopura (A), Central Sanctuary (B), Gallery (D), Walls (Z1 and Z2) near Libraries, and Tower (Q) took place. Fifth-stage buildings are characterized by large sandstone blocks and pediments with five-headed nagas.The construction sequence described above is almost in harmony with the change of pediment end styles from pediments ending in scrolls made from one block, to pediments ending in scrolls made from two blocks, and finally to pediments ending in five-headed nagas. In addition, the construction sequence suggests that the sandstone block size increased over time.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsEU and AM conceived and coordinated this research.

Generally, composition of the weathering crusts and patinas of Euganean trachyte proves to be an informative marker for the relevant environmental conditions and their evolution.KeywordsBuilding stone decayAir pollutionWeathering crustMortar dissolutionLeachingMineral mobilizationEuganean trachyte\nIntroductionAir quality is a key factor affecting stone weathering in urban environment, where concentration of stoneworks is generally large and, at the same time, human activities are intense and diverse. The latter change in time and space, and so does their contribution to pollution. Time variations in quantity and quality of pollutant emissions strongly depend on changes in fuel use [1]. SO2 emissions have represented a major concern until the 20th century, but considerably declined in Europe during the last decades, by one or two orders of magnitude in cities, determining a general improvement of air quality [2]; however, globally, increasing coal demand according to recent projections [3\u20135] and, for example, the latest changes in climate policies in the USA [6], may revert this tendency. Nowadays, the higher concentration of other pollutants, such as N oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and O3, must be reassessed. Road transport, domestic heating, industry, and power plants are the main pollution sources in urban areas, but their relative importance has changed with time as well [7].In the modern urban environment, a multi-pollutant scenario arises with a major incidence of airborne particulate, having high concentration of elemental C (soot) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), with fuel combustion from road traffic as the main contributor [8, 9]. This carbonaceous matter exhibits high specific surface area and contains heavy metals and aluminum\u2013silicon particles, which act as catalysts and adsorbents for organic compounds [10]. Pollutant interaction with stone preferentially occurs through short-range dry deposition. Overall, the well-known processes of crust formation are becoming less significant in favor of soiling, characterized by an increasing enrichment in organic C, i.e., aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [11\u201314]. In urban environment, dry deposition is more significant than wet deposition, but a notable danger is still represented by short drizzles, fog, and dew, which have higher pH, do not remove previous acid deposits, and provide sufficient moisture for their chemical activation [15\u201317].Most studies on the interaction between building stone and urban environment have focused so far on weathering of carbonate rocks, their dissolution, and formation of gypsum crusts [18]; other rock types have been investigated more rarely.Deterioration of trachyte has also received scarce attention in the literature, not only because of its generally good durability. In fact, its use is historically less common if compared to other volcanic rocks, i.e., tuff above all, andesite, and basalt. These rock types have been quarried in Europe, Latin America, Middle and Far East and so on, and employed by some of the most important ancient civilizations, like the Romans, Egyptians, Greeks, Incas, and Aztecs [19, 20]. Trachyte use has not been such widespread, with an exploitation mostly limited to Europe, namely Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, and France, as well as the Azores and Canary Islands.Most studies on trachyte weathering have focused on coastal salt-aggressive environments, such as those of Venice and Naples in Italy, and the Azores islands. Several deterioration patterns have been observed, including scaling, powdering, exfoliation, blistering, differential erosion, and efflorescence. They result to be mainly determined by cyclic processes of in-pore salt crystallization related to sea-salt supply. The phases involved are halite, gypsum, thenardite, and mirabilite and, in indoor environments, also trona and natron [21\u201324]. Only Lazzarini et al. [23] have addressed in detail the on-site decay of trachyte of the Euganean Hills, subject of the present paper; in this regard, Germinario et al. [25], in a recent work, explored the link between the changing petrophysical and mechanical properties of that stone and its diverse durability and resistance to water-driven weathering.Few studies have also focused on trachyte used in inland continental climates, as in Czech Republic [26] and Germany [27]. In particular, Graue et al. [27] have examined weathering crusts of trachyte in industrial, urban and rural environments, showing how their thickness, grain size, and enrichment in heavy metals and other exogenous components well correlate with different degrees and sources of anthropogenic air pollution.In this paper, the problem of trachyte decay in urban environment is tackled investigating the mineralogical, microstructural and chemical characteristics of weathering crusts and patinas detected on trachyte of the Euganean Hills used in the Renaissance city walls of Padua, in northern Italy. Trachyte alteration is discussed referring to environmental parameters, in particular concerning air quality and anthropic pollution sources, which are examined based on measured or modeled pollution data and placed in a cause-effect relationship with the weathering products. The influence of composition of the stone and other neighboring materials on specific weathering processes is also debated.\nThe city walls of PaduaPadua has a composite wall system surrounding the historical district gone through millennia of history and several layouts and building phases, dated to the Roman age, the Middle Ages (12th\u201314th century), and, finally, the Renaissance.The latest wall circuit, the best preserved today, was built roughly following the previous Medieval perimeter by the Republic of Venice Serenissima, an ancient state of northern Italy (697\u20131797). The supremacy of Serenissima in Padua began in 1405, but the works for new defensive walls started one century later, during and after the war with the League of Cambrai, an alliance formed in 1508 by the major European powers attempting to hinder the expansionist goals of Venice. The difficulties encountered in defending Padua, the most important mainland city, and the ongoing technological military innovations forced Serenissima to plan the construction of a new fortification system. This started in 1513 and continued until half of the century, with the realization of walls with an 11\u00a0km perimeter, 19 bastions, 8 gates, and several bridges, protected by moats, rivers, and channels (Fig.\u00a01). What can be seen today is the result of the extensive modifications and demolitions of several parts of the curtain walls and two gates occurred under urbanization pressure from the 19th century [28, 29].\n\nFig.\u00a01\nThe Renaissance city walls of Padua raised by the Republic of Venice Serenissima: a Porta Savonarola gate, with a wall segment; b Castelnuovo circular bastion with a water gate facing a channel; c Cornaro pentagonal bastion\n\nThe Renaissance wall system was built almost completely using bricks for the outer surfaces, with a core filled with rubble of bricks and stones consolidated with mortar. Trachyte was used not only as stone blocks in the core. It was employed for stringcourses, parapets, ashlars on angular ends of the bastions and other minor elements, as well as for building some of the gates (Porta Savonarola, Porta San Giovanni, Porta Santa Croce, and Porta Liviana-Pontecorvo).A set of 22 trachyte samples was collected on four different segments of the Renaissance walls for analyzing their weathering crusts and patinas. Stringcourses on curtains and roundels as well as ashlars of an angled bastion were sampled, their localization being indicated in Fig.\u00a02. During sampling, spots with different exposure were chosen; in the case of stringcourses, samples from the upper, frontal and lower surface were collected. To our knowledge, no cleaning restoration intervention was ever carried out on the sampled stone elements.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nThe present-day circuit of the Renaissance city walls of Padua (satellite image from \u00a92016 Google), with sampling areas indicated, and two examples of weathering crusts and patinas on Euganean trachyte used for a stringcourse and as filling material in the wall core\n\n\nEuganean trachyteThe trachyte used in the Renaissance walls was extracted in the quarry district of the Euganean Hills, a group of hills located near Padua formed by a sedimentary succession of limestones and marls of the upper Jurassic\u2014lower Oligocene, a Paleogene volcanic and hypabyssal series, and Quaternary detrital deposits. Trachytes are ascribable to a subvolcanic series dated to the lower Oligocene, and have acid to intermediate composition and moderate Na-alkaline affinity [30, 31].From a petrographic point of view, Euganean trachyte is a holocrystalline to hypocrystalline rock with porphyritic texture and a mineralogical composition given mostly by feldspars (anorthoclase, plagioclase, and sanidine, in diverse combination), biotite and, occasionally, augite and kaersutite. The accessory minerals typically comprise quartz, cristobalite, Ti-magnetite, ilmenite, apatite, and zircon. Groundmass is composed by alkali-feldspar microlites usually with a felty texture, or sometimes showing preferred orientations [32].The exploitation of Euganean trachyte started in Pre-Protohistory, but became more intense from Roman times. This material has been extensively used as carving and building stone in northern and central Italy and nearby its borders. Querns, mortars, cippi, milestones, steles, urns, tombstones, and sarcophagi comprise the most common artifacts crafted with trachyte all through the centuries. Euganean trachyte was widely used in the built environment too, as an instance for the admirable roads and other great infrastructure of the Roman age or the monumental architecture and construction from the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Indeed, with the rise of the Republic of Venice Serenissima, stone construction was given a substantial boost, and trachyte was largely employed in public buildings, churches, monasteries, monumental gates, defensive walls and private residences, as well as for paving squares and streets; the most striking examples can be admired in Padua and Venice ([32, 33] and references therein).\nExperimental methodsThe trachyte samples collected on the walls of Padua were analyzed in order to determine their mineralogical, microstructural and chemical characteristics, using the facilities of the Geoscience Center of Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen.Rock thin sections both parallel and perpendicular to the exposed surface were investigated with a polarized-light microscope and a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) FEI Quanta 200 FEG equipped with a ZrO/W Schottky field-emission gun and detector for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). In addition to usual observations and phase identifications, carried out on gold-coated samples, the SEM was used for acquiring X-ray elemental maps of selected cross sections, operating at 20\u00a0kV acceleration voltage, and scanning a grid of 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0400 pixels with a dwell time of 300\u00a0ms.Powdery and incoherent samples were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) with a Philips PW 1800 diffractometer equipped with Cu anode operating at 45\u00a0kV and 30\u00a0mA, measuring with scan steps of 0.02\u00b02\u03b8 in the range 3\u201370\u00b02\u03b8 and an integration time of 4\u00a0s.Furthermore, analyses by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) were performed in order to determine major- and trace-element composition of both the altered layers and fresh host rock. The latter, prepared as polished samples embedded in epoxy, was analyzed with a Thermo Scientific Element 2 double-focusing magnetic-sector spectrometer coupled to a Resonetics Resolution 193\u00a0nm Ar-F excimer laser; data were acquired along 1.5\u00a0mm-long profiles and average compositions calculated. Instead, the crusts and patinas were analyzed as they are, given the difficulty in preparing polished sections due to their limited thickness. For these samples, a Perkin Elmer ELAN DRC II quadrupole spectrometer was used coupled to a Lambda Physik COMPex 110 193\u00a0nm Ar-F excimer laser. Data were acquired on profiles on the entire sample surface (centimetric in size) and average compositions calculated. Both lasers operated at 7\u00a0Hz repetition rate, 3\u00a0J/cm2 fluence, 7\u00a0\u00b5m/s velocity, and using a spot size of 120\u00a0\u00b5m. Element concentrations were calculated with Iolite v2.5 software package, by a script based on the following procedure: the LA-ICPMS signal is first smoothed by ratioing to an appropriate denominator isotope present in the sample and standard (29Si); the element ratios are standardized with NIST 610 glass reference material; then, they are normalized to oxides sum to reach 100%, including all the elements [34].\nWeathering analysis\nMineralogy and microstructure\nMicroscopic observations reveal that the thickness of the weathering crusts and patinas on the exposed surfaces is rather limited, often below few tens of micrometers, and only exceptionally may reach few hundreds of micrometers. Sometimes, powdery and incoherent deposits are also observed.\nAlmost all the samples have a high C content, responsible for the black-greyish color of many crusts and patinas. Subspherical carbonaceous particles may be isolated, grouped in small clusters (Fig.\u00a03a), or form extensive layers, possibly displaying fractures and microcracks (Fig.\u00a03b). Soot represents a container for further accumulation of pollutants, indeed it may be rich in heavy metals, especially Pb, or include exogenous quartz, aluminosilicate minerals, chlorides, Al oxides, etc.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nSEM-BSE photomicrographs showing different features of the carbonaceous fraction (darker in the images) detected on the weathering crusts and patinas of Euganean trachyte and its microchemical composition by EDS measured on two different spots (signal from gold coating is also visible). a Cluster of subspherical carbonaceous particles. b Microcracked patina with crumbled fine-grained feldspars. c Carbonaceous mass with Fe oxides, carbonates, and quartz. d Aggregates of carbonaceous particles arranged along the edges and the internal fractures of a plagioclase phenocryst\n\n\nThe airborne carbonaceous pollutants are frequently trapped in crusts formed by microcrystalline calcite and, secondarily, dolomite (Fig.\u00a04). The high concentration of these phases cannot be traced back to trachyte composition, since they are originally present in low or negligible amount. A high content of quartz is often detected as well.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nSEM\u2013EDS X-ray maps of a calcite crust of Euganean trachyte prepared as epoxy-embedded cross section, with the exposed surface displayed on the top (field size: 523.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0406.6\u00a0\u00b5m)\n\n\nThe carbonaceous particles may be also associated with a matrix rich in Fe, present as oxides and hydroxides or in amorphous state, giving a general brown-reddish color, in possible combination with carbonates (Fig.\u00a03c).\nIn the thinnest patinas, there are virtually no intermediate alteration layers between the host rock and the carbonaceous components, the adhesion of which takes place directly on the feldspars constituting the substrate; their fine grain size and crumbled appearance, which creates a porous surface favoring C deposition, suggests former processes of granular disintegration. C accumulates mainly on the groundmass or fine-grained phenocrysts, taking advantage of intercrystalline spaces and higher porosity, whereas large phenocrysts are less affected (Fig.\u00a03d).\nGypsum crusts are detected on a single sample, very close to a mortar splash by the joint of two trachyte blocks. Its collocation, on the lower side of a stringcourse, was a shelter against direct rainfall and washing out. The microscopic investigation revealed a complex stratigraphy (Fig.\u00a05). The superficial layer is composed of a network of acicular or tabular gypsum crystals with rosette-like intergrowths, which embeds carbonaceous particles, but in rather low concentration. The second underlying layer is composed of amorphous silica. The third layer is constituted mostly of calcite, directly crystallized on the host rock. The presence of separate gypsum and calcite levels suggests a slow-rate alteration process, started with the crystallization and growth of a carbonate layer and its later, partial reaction with S, mostly limited to its outermost part. The gypsum layer represents a rather compact domain, whereas the underlying host rock shows a high degree of fracturing.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nSEM\u2013EDS X-ray maps of a gypsum crust of Euganean trachyte prepared as epoxy-embedded cross section, with the exposed surface displayed on the top (field size: 524.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0407.3\u00a0\u00b5m). Details of the gypsum crystals and the fractured host rock beneath the crust are showed in the SEM-BSE photomicrographs\n\n\nThe XRPD analyses of powdery and incoherent deposits sampled on trachyte confirm the occurrence of some of the mineral phases detected through the SEM observations and microanalyses. Quartz, calcite, and dolomite are the major components, while the other identified phases comprise minerals from the host rock, like feldspars and biotite, or from their alteration, such as illite and chlorite (Fig.\u00a06).\n\nFig.\u00a06\nXRPD spectrum of a powdery deposit on Euganean trachyte, showing a composition given mostly by quartz, calcite, and dolomite\n\n\n\nMajor- and trace-element composition\nThe LA-ICPMS analyses of major elements (Table\u00a01) substantially confirm the occurrence of two main alteration types, characterized by a high concentration of calcite and Fe. If the average composition of Euganean trachyte in Germinario et al. [32] is taken as reference, the calcite crusts and patinas show an increase of CaO by a factor from 7 up to 60, corresponding to a maximum concentration of 86%. At the same time, a decrease in the content of SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, and K2O is always evident, up to a maximum of 87, 93, 97, and 98%, respectively. A modest increase of MgO, associated with dolomite presence, is also noticeable. The different ratios between CaO and the feldspar-related elements reveal different degrees of alteration and homogeneity of the weathering layers, hence to what extent the silicate host rock has been obliterated by newly formed phases. As pointed out before, enrichment in carbonates and Fe may be associated but, when the latter is predominant, a Fe increase by a factor up to 6.5 is recorded. Although a general surface sulfation is often evident, only in the gypsum crust a large increase in SO3 is reported, by a factor of 2487, corresponding to a concentration of 25%, which almost completely hides the silicate composition of the host rock, in association with the high content of CaO.Table\u00a01\nMajor-element chemical composition expressed as oxide weight percent of representative samples of Euganean trachyte from the Renaissance city walls of Padua determined by LA-ICPMS, on both surface (i.e., weathering crust or patina) and host rock (inner part)\nSampleSiO2\nTiO2\nAl2O3\nFe2O3\nMnOMgOCaONa2OK2OP2O5\nSO3\n\nCalcite-rich alteration\nSCR-01\u00a0Surface8.570.021.140.580.041.4985.850.170.120.690.38\u00a0Host rock63.690.1218.090.760.010.144.406.184.560.040.45GAR-03\u00a0Surface52.040.1713.403.980.311.2116.293.280.833.211.18\u00a0Host rock67.170.0918.080.910.000.201.515.755.700.120.10CSN-03\u00a0Surface55.100.4011.593.510.091.5115.603.000.971.422.93\u00a0Host rock65.780.1118.312.040.010.351.035.825.630.040.06SCR-05\u00a0Surface58.500.1913.813.310.050.7210.422.770.551.220.44\u00a0Host rock67.890.3015.961.970.020.591.695.265.210.170.12\nIron-rich alteration\nSCR-07\u00a0Surface40.970.3914.2721.190.151.225.221.960.577.470.82\u00a0Host rock68.090.1517.231.340.020.401.215.325.640.100.08\nWeak alteration\nFST-07\u00a0Surface66.200.1317.712.990.120.333.735.070.910.720.65\u00a0Host rock69.080.0616.460.840.010.122.015.204.330.070.11\nGypsum-rich alteration\nFST-05\u00a0Surface5.440.010.410.110.000.1766.071.340.120.5824.87\u00a0Host rock70.620.2314.931.290.010.321.054.016.320.030.19Average composition of Euganean trachytea\n66.020.6616.773.260.060.661.425.045.350.210.01\nThe samples are divided by different types of alteration and sampling location as in Fig.\u00a02 (SCR, Bastione Santa Croce; GAR, Torrione dell\u2019Arena; CSN, Bastione Castelnuovo; FST, Torrione Venier)\n\na\u00a0Bulk-rock chemical composition determined by X-ray fluorescence and averaged among 86 fresh trachyte samples collected on the Euganean Hills in 40 different quarries and outcrops [32]\n\n\nFurther indications are given by the concentration of trace elements (a selection is reported in Table\u00a02, while the complete dataset is included in Additional file 1).

Calcite and gypsum tend to form microcrystalline domains more compact than the underlying host rock, so that mechanisms of dry and wet deposition of pollutants are hindered. This is confirmed by a higher content of heavy metals on the stone surfaces exhibiting only a weak incipient alteration, maybe only recently exposed (e.g., due to previous detachment of outer layers). On the other hand, non-uniform crusts, which do not entirely cover the host rock, represent an intermediate condition: storage of airborne carbonaceous particles and surface accumulation of metallic pollutants are enhanced because of a relatively high porosity, given by a mix of disaggregated host rock and uneven, incomplete and scarcely adhering crystallization of newly formed phases. In this case, an enrichment in CaO, Fe2O3, and heavy metals is clear, but the contribution of the silicate substrate to the chemical composition of the stone surface is still distinct.\n\nFig.\u00a08\nComparison of the major- and trace-element composition measured by LA-ICPMS on the weathering crusts and patinas of representative samples of Euganean trachyte. Sample names and compositions refer to Tables\u00a01 and 2\n\n\n\nFinally, the relationship between trachyte sampling point and sample composition suggests the following considerations: the samples collected on the frontal sides of stringcourses or ashlars feature a higher concentration of carbonates on average, thus indicating a major incidence of calcite-rich alteration on vertical surfaces; the samples collected on the lower sides, including the gypsum crusts, display lower concentrations of heavy metals; no specific alteration trends dependent on the sampling site were recognized.\n\nCorrelation with air quality\nEnvironmental setting\nIn order to establish a correlation between trachyte alteration and air quality, it is necessary to describe the environmental setting the stone interacts with.\nPadua is a city of about 200,000 people in the Veneto region, northeastern Italy, located in the Po Plain about 20\u00a0km far from the Venetian Lagoon and 40\u00a0km from the coastline of the Adriatic Sea.\nThe climate is humid temperate (K\u00f6ppen classification: \u201cCfa\u201d). It features hot summers, with record maximum temperatures usually exceeding 35\u00a0\u00b0C, and mild to cold winters, when minimum temperatures may easily drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0C. The most humid period in the year is between fall and winter, whereas late-spring and summer months are the driest. Rainfall is concentrated during fall and spring, while winter has the lowest precipitation. Spring is usually the windiest season (Table\u00a03).Table\u00a03\nClimatic parameters measured in Padua averaged from 2000 to 2015.\nSource: ARPAV\nClimatic parameterValueClimatic parameterValue\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\nPrecipitation (mm)\nAnnual mean14.5Annual total959Annual mean min10.7Lowest annual total561Annual mean max19.1Highest annual total1395Lowest monthly mean and monthly mean min (month)3.9/1.5 (January)Lowest monthly total (month)58 (January)Highest monthly mean and monthly mean max (month)24.7/30.2 (July)Highest monthly total (month)107 (November)\nRelative humidity (%)\n\nPrecipitation days\nAnnual mean74Annual total (\u2265 1 mm)84Annual mean min53Annual mean max91\nSolar irradiance (MJ/m\n\n2\n\n)\nLowest monthly mean and monthly mean min (month)65/43 (July)Annual total (Legnaro, 1994\u20132015)5005Highest monthly mean and monthly mean max (month)84/94 (November)\nWind direction\nAnnual meanNE\n\nThe pH value of rainfall is from 5.5 to 6 on average,1 which is the conventional value of unpolluted rainwater, i.e., 5.6 [36].\nConcerning air quality, the most significant pollution sources in Padua, besides road traffic and domestic combustion, are the only two major industrial plants in the city area, namely a waste-to-energy incinerator and a steel plant, about 3 and 6\u00a0km far from downtown, respectively. Compared to the pollution measured in background areas, traffic zones present a concentration of NOx increased by a factor of 1.5, whereas near industrial plants the same increase in the concentration of SO2 is registered, as well as an enrichment in heavy metals in the PM fraction, by a factor up to over 2 (Table\u00a04). Finally, the influence of the industrial area of Venice-Porto Marghera, one of the largest coastal industrial zones in Europe, located 30\u00a0km far from Padua, cannot be ruled out. In its area of over 20\u00a0km2, chemical, petrochemical and petroleum industries, refineries, thermal power stations, metallurgical industries, air separation and natural-gas processing plants, incinerators, etc. are operational. The emissions comprise mainly SO2, NOx, CO, PM, and VOC [37\u201339], which are easily transported to Padua by winds having usually a NE direction.Table\u00a04\nConcentration of air pollutants measured in Padua in different locations and expressed as hourly grand means, for gaseous pollutants, and daily grand means, for PM10.\n\nSource: ARPAV\nMeasurement stationCO(mg/m3)NO(\u00b5g/m3)NO2\n(\u00b5g/m3)\u03a3 NOx\n(\u00b5g/m3)SO2\n(\u00b5g/m3)O3\n(\u00b5g/m3)PM10\n(\u00b5g/m3)As(ng/m3)Cd(ng/m3)Ni(ng/m3)Pb(ng/m3)C6H6\n(\u00b5g/m3)C20H12\n(ng/m3)\u00a0\nPM\n\n10\n\ncomposition\nBackground\u00a0Whole record0.729.942.188.42.552.543.01.40.93.417.72.11.3\u00a0Last 5 years (2011\u20132015)0.623.034.869.61.651.739.30.70.43.59.71.71.4Traffic\u00a0Whole record0.853.253.0132.62.445.243.41.51.03.817.43.31.3\u00a0Last 5 years (2011\u20132015)0.429.844.089.82.445.636.80.80.53.69.73.61.2Industrial I\u00a0Whole record\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n43.01.51.36.745.2\nn/a\n1.2\u00a0Last 5 years (2011\u20132015)\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n37.91.00.54.121.3\nn/a\n1.3Industrial II\u00a0Whole record0.735.042.295.93.739.437.20.90.53.010.0\nn/a\n1.1\u00a0Last 5 years (2011\u20132015)0.626.638.779.61.843.036.00.90.53.09.3\nn/a\n1.3\nThe records comprise the following periods: for gaseous pollutants, from 2000 to 2015 (Background and Traffic stations) and from 2001 to 2015 (Industrial II station); for PM10, from 2003 to 2015 (Background, Traffic and Industrial I stations) and from 2008 to 2015 (Industrial II station)\nIndustrial I: one station monitoring the emissions from a local steel mill\nIndustrial II: two stations monitoring the emissions from a local waste-to-energy incinerator\n\n\n\nExogenous processes\nThe mineralogical and chemical identity of the alterations of Euganean trachyte can be related to air pollution, so that composition of the weathering crusts and patinas turns out to be a marker for the relevant environmental conditions and their evolution.\nThe enrichment in C and heavy metals can be traced back to the particulate deriving mostly from road traffic, emitted by diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles, and domestic combustion of woody biomass. These are the main sources of total suspended particulate (TSP) in Padua, according to the emission projections by ARPAV agency [40]2 summarized in Fig.\u00a09. A further major source of particulate is fuel-free industrial processes in the steel mill (\u201cproductive processes\u201d); as indicated in Table\u00a04, its emissions have a relatively high content of Pb, Ni, and As, so this can be directly related to the enrichment in heavy metals detected on the weathering crusts. By comparison, TSP produced by the local incinerator (\u201cwaste treatment and disposal\u201d) is almost negligible. If the contribution from the industrial area of Venice-Porto Marghera is also considered, a further supply of carbonaceous pollutants and heavy metals can be identified mainly from the power stations, refinery, petroleum industries, and the related employment of fuels and machines. Conditions of high air humidity and precipitation and strong wind are the most favorable for pollutant dispersion, so that summer can be considered the least dangerous season. Carbonaceous and metallic particles act as catalysts, so their accumulation enhance further stone alteration and crust growth [41].\n\nFig.\u00a09\nEstimated emissions of the major air pollutants in Padua during 2010 by several macro-groups of anthropic and natural activities, and comparison with emissions calculated for Venice in the same year, mainly deriving from the industrial area of Porto Marghera (INEMAR projections [40])\n\n\nAmong other exogenous processes contributing to the weathering of Euganean trachyte, it is worth mentioning the possible reactions leading to the formation of the carbonate crusts. Considering the originally low concentration of calcite and dolomite in the host rock, the only plausible and consistent source for these phases is identified in lime and Mg-lime mortars used in the walls of Padua for joining trachyte blocks. Indeed, Ca carbonate may be dissolved from mortars by acid solutions and reprecipitate in basic ones; calcite is less stable, i.e., its dissolution is faster, when pH is lower than about 5\u20136: dissolution rate increases with increasing H+ activity, in high-acidity regime, or CO2 partial pressure, in low-acidity regime [42\u201344]. As reported above, average pH of rainfall in Padua is around 5.5\u20136, just around the limit of calcite stability. This means that pH fluctuations3 to higher acidity may increase leachability of Ca carbonate from mortars; the resulting solution containing leached Ca(OH)2, thus an alkaline medium [36], continues its short-range path, and may easily reach trachyte elements (especially subvertical substrates), wetting their surface and penetrating into pores; finally, calcite reprecipitates, taking advantage of the alkaline pH. Carbonate recrystallization episodes might be more common in summertime, whereas dissolution process possibly takes place more frequently during late fall and winter: in the cold season, atmosphere acidity is generally higher due to domestic heating and related emissions, and low temperatures increase calcite solubility [45]; higher humidity and precipitation represent other favorable factors, as well as the recurrence of misty days, with fog being more acid than rainfall, with pH even below 4 [13, 36].\nThe role of neighboring mortars acting as Ca source for trachyte weathering has been outlined by previous studies too [21, 22, 27]. It seems to be confirmed also by the formation of the gypsum crusts very close to a mortar joint, and the possible supply of quartz, sulfates, chlorides, etc. from the mortar aggregate. The layers of amorphous silica might develop from the dissolution of either the mortar or the rock-forming silicate minerals or glass-bearing domains in trachyte [46]. Quartz might be also derived by Saharan dust, long-range transported from Africa by Sirocco: when this wind rises to pass over the Alps further north than Padua, the desert particles, composed of silicates and carbonates, are scavenged by rainfall and may precipitate in the Po Plain [15, 16].\nOn the other hand, the gypsum crusts might be also connected to anthropogenic air pollutants, i.e., to SO2 oxidation and hydration and the well-known subsequent reaction of H2SO4 with a Ca carbonate substrate, in this case formed on trachyte after mortar leaching. The high degree of fracturing of the underlying host rock suggests an initial penetration of Ca-rich solutions in the outer pores, then producing crystallization pressures during water evaporation up to rock failure. Gypsum possibly formed after subsequent Ca loading and growing outwards of the carbonate crystallization layer, on surfaces sheltered from direct rainfall and washing out. Concerning SO2 supply, the most important contribution is given by the emissions of the steel mill. Anyway, the overall concentration of SO2 is rather low in Padua and not comparable to that typical of big urban and industrial centers [13], and presumably it was so even in the past. This\u2014other than the carbonate-poor composition of trachyte\u2014justifies the very limited extension of the gypsum crusts and their rare occurrence [47]. A hypothesis that can be completely discarded is the nucleation of gypsum directly from soot absorbing pollutants [48], given its low concentration and, on the other hand, the large extension of the gypsum crusts.\nFinally, it is worth reminding that no evident effect of interaction between trachyte and sea salts carried by wind or rainwater was noticed. Indeed, the typical weathering products connected to coastal environment identified in previous studies [22, 23], in particular high concentrations of halite, were not found here. The scant chlorides detected have to be traced back to mortar composition instead, as stated above.\nOn the other hand, composition of the weathering products of Euganean trachyte can be compared to that detected in inland environment on Drachenfels trachyte studied by Graue et al. [27]. The main difference lies in a greater incidence of CaO enrichment and calcite recrystallization on surface alteration of Euganean trachyte, whereas the framboidal crusts analyzed on Drachenfels trachyte in an urban and industrial setting generally are thicker (centimetric size), richer in well-developed gypsum crystals, and may show stronger sulfation and higher concentration of heavy metals. Nevertheless, if Pb concentration is the term for comparison, that analyzed in the crusts and patinas of Euganean trachyte is often close to the typical values measured in European cities, i.e., from few hundreds ppm up to 2000\u00a0ppm [27].\n\nStone leaching\nSome features of the weathering crusts and patinas of Euganean trachyte can be explained by intrinsic factors, in particular the Fe-rich alterations. Microscopic examinations disclosed an enrichment in fine-grained Fe oxides and hydroxides and amorphous Fe in the proximity of biotite phenocrysts and, secondarily, magnetite and ilmenite crystals (Fig.\u00a010). This suggests Fe mobilization from the minerals by leaching and migration to surface, forming brown-reddish alteration layers. Leaching might have also occurred at the expense of mafic xenoliths [23] or pervasive migration fronts of Fe oxides/hydroxides, genetically linked to post-magmatic processes [32]. Leaching of biotite seems more likely, since solubility of magnetite and ilmenite is lower. Fe2+ release from the octahedral layers of biotite is strongly pH dependent: rate of dissolution linearly increases with decreasing pH, but the reaction is significant only for values lower than 4\u20135 [49\u201351]. The environmental conditions leading to the formation of the Fe-rich crusts and patinas would be similar to those described for the calcite crusts, involving pH fluctuations around the limit of the stability field even of biotite; in this case, however, its lower leachability if compared to that of calcite requires a more acid environment for dissolution to get started. Finally, a minor contribution of PM to Fe enrichment of trachyte surfaces must be taken into account, however that is not the main source, as also confirmed by the absence of Fe compounds in the incoherent and powdery surface deposits of exogenous origin.\n\nFig.\u00a010\nThin-section photomicrographs of samples of Euganean trachyte with Fe-rich crusts, showing dispersion of fine-grained Fe oxides/hydroxides or Fe in amorphous state around a biotite crystal (left) and two opaque minerals (i.e., magnetite or ilmenite) (right), apparently indicating near-surface mineral leaching\n\n\nA leaching process of the host-rock has been supposed also with regard to dissolution of plagioclase and release of Ca2+ cations, as an alternative or concurrent mechanism of formation of the calcite crusts. In Euganean trachyte, plagioclase represents one of the main mineral phases, it has a prevalent oligoclase\u2013andesine composition with an average CaO content of 6% [32], so theoretically it is a possible source of Ca [52, 53]. However, the overall CaO content of the bulk rock is rather low on average (1.4%, see Table\u00a01). Additionally, in acid solutions, Ca leachability from plagioclase is rather low, especially taking calcite as a term of comparison or even Fe release from biotite [46, 54]. Leaching is also facilitated in fine-grained crystals, whereas plagioclases are among the coarsest phenocrysts in Euganean trachyte, even reaching a centimetric size. Moreover, clay minerals, typically resulting from feldspar alteration, were detected only in minor amounts (their concentration in the host rock is also rather low or negligible). For all these reasons, plagioclase cannot be considered the primary source of such a high concentration of carbonates in the crusts, although its contribution cannot be totally excluded.\n\nConclusionsThe crusts and patinas of Euganean trachyte related to urban weathering have mostly limited thickness and extension. They are rich in heavy metals and carbonaceous matter, which promote further accumulation of pollutants, mainly derived from fuel use in road transport and domestic combustion, and, secondarily, short- and medium-range industrial emissions. These products are typically embedded in matrixes rich in calcite or Fe (either as oxides/hydroxides or amorphous components). The crusts and patinas also include grains of quartz, dolomite, and other minor components, such as metallic and aluminum\u2013silicon particles, chlorides, etc. The high concentration of carbonates cannot derive from host rock components; pH-controlled dissolution, mobilization, and recrystallization of carbonates from nearby lime mortars used in joints seems the most plausible source of Ca. This process may also occur on seasonal basis, depending on pH fluctuations. A secondary and very limited source of Ca can be represented by dissolution of plagioclases. A more likely intrinsic process of alteration affects biotite and other Fe-bearing minerals, through pH-dependent leaching of Fe and its migration to surface. Other alteration forms recognized comprise powdery deposits and gypsum crusts, but they do not occur commonly. The latter possibly derive from the contribution of SO2 pollutant, having a rather low concentration in the air though; the presence of sulfate impurities in mortar aggregate and their leaching can be alternatively invoked. When present, thick, homogeneous and well-developed crusts, rich in either calcite or gypsum, partially shield the host rock from further pollutant absorption.From this study, it arises that most of the alteration products of Euganean trachyte are due to exogenous processes, whereas the stone itself does not have particular compositional features prone to trigger major dangerous mechanisms of decay. Generally, composition of the weathering crusts and patinas of Euganean trachyte proves to be an informative marker for the relevant environmental conditions and their evolution, with a strict link with air pollution determined by different anthropic pollution sources.Further studies are needed concerning trachyte-mortar interaction, in order to explore to what extent mortar affects stone surface alteration and in which microclimatic conditions, what is the mobilization potential of the leached components, and the influence of different mortar recipes.\nFootnotes1No recent institutional data are available, so the value indicated has been assumed from alternative sources: dated measurements in Padua [16] and Venice (RIDEP network, 1988), as well as recent datasets from mountain localities in Veneto (CONECOFOR network and TESAF, Padua). For proposing that pH value, lower accuracy of dated analyses, sampling location, and the general reduction of emissions during the last decades have been taken into account.\u00a02INEMAR projections by ARPAV agency contain space- and time-based estimations of the yearly emissions in the atmosphere generated by several anthropic and natural activities that, given the complexity and amount of the possible sources, could not be all exactly calculated. The estimations are based on both real measured data and theoretical indicators, the latter inferred from statistical data and exploratory surveys concerning population, territory, economy, development, etc. [40].\u00a03pH fluctuations of an aqueous solution can occur due to leaching of stones/mortars or solubilization of acid particles previously dry-deposited on their surface. Fluctuations also depend on the current general air quality and other large-scale factors: for example, a short drizzle or the initial stage of a rainfall are more acid, since the highly-soluble anthropogenic pollutants are first gathered; in a later stage, airborne alkaline agents reacting with slower kinetics and solubility\u2014e.g., NH3 from agricultural fertilizers, soil particles, wind-transported Saharan dust, etc.\u2014make water pH increase [15, 16].\u00a0Abbreviations\nEDS:\u00a0\nenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n\nFE-SEM:\u00a0\nfield-emission scanning electron microscope\n\nLA-ICPMS:\u00a0\nlaser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry\n\nPM:\u00a0\nparticulate matter\n\nSEM:\u00a0\nscanning electron microscope\n\nTSP:\u00a0\ntotal suspended particulate\n\nVOC:\u00a0\nvolatile organic compounds\n\nXRPD:\u00a0\nX-ray powder diffraction\n\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsThis paper has been extracted from the Ph.D. thesis written by LG, after a research work supervised by CM and co-supervised by LM at the University of Padova.

However, the methods and materials Bauer utilised in order to reproduce colour with astonishing accuracy in the 966 paintings of plants and 293 paintings of animals he produced for the endeavour during the period 1788\u20131794 has not been scrutinised. In particular, Bauer\u2019s palette and his use of a complex numerical colour code system used for both the Flora Graeca and the lesser known and unpublished Fauna Graeca have not been extensively discussed. This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of non-destructive, in situ methods to identify pigments used in Bauer\u2019s watercolour paintings and gain insight into how the artist worked in the field. Part of a larger research project at the Bodleian Library, the study was instrumental in unravelling the artist\u2019s colour code and understanding how his palette evolved over time by comparing pigments from 125 paintings from the Flora and Fauna Graeca with those identified in both an early painted colour chart [1, 2, 5] and in a number of later paintings [6].Previous studies have used Raman spectroscopy, XRF, FORS and imaging spectroscopy for the non-invasive study of watercolour pigments in both manuscripts and paintings on paper [7\u201313]. Although more interventive technologies such as Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) have yielded better results with watercolour pigments, [14] these require either sampling, or direct contact with the surface of the object, something that is often not permitted in heritage collections. Furthermore, portable analytical studies are generally reliant on commercial instruments designed for general analytical work, rarely optimised for works on paper. The following study involves the use of bespoke Raman spectrometer and FORS systems, which have built entirely for the purposes of analysing pigments in works on paper and manuscripts.The reduction in cost, and wider availability of non-invasive, portable instrumentation have facilitated identification of artists\u2019 pigments in heritage objects for which it would have been otherwise impossible [7\u20139]. In addition to portable XRF, the availability of portable Raman systems has also increased in recent years. The relatively low cost of these systems have made them an attractive prospect for heritage institutions. However, the laser powers employed by many portable Raman systems are typically set at levels to provide the optimal signal-to-noise ratio for robust samples but often exceed the level at which photosensitive pigments can be damaged or the nature of the pigment altered [15, 16]. For example, exposure to even very low laser power (>\u00a01 mW) has been shown to rapidly transform iron oxide minerals, especially where they were poorly crystallised [17]. A comparison of a number of portable Raman systems, commercially-available in 2016, demonstrated that laser powers between 30 and 500 mW minimum were common with many systems. The typical power densities used in these systems are therefore likely to significantly exceed the threshold for use with certain heritage objects [15]. Not all manufacturers of portable systems quote a spot size in their literature, and therefore power densities for these systems are not possible to state categorically. However, unless otherwise stated by the manufacturer, the spot size for any Raman microscope may be assumed to be diffraction limited (i.e.: d\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bb/2NA).A bespoke Raman spectroscopy system has been designed and built at Durham University and optimised specifically for the analysis of pigments on books, manuscripts and works of art on paper. The benefits of using the Raman system are manifold: it is sensitive enough to identify many artists\u2019 pigments at laser power densities low enough to prevent photodegradation of light sensitive materials (20\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122), it allows for the sampling of a very small area (ca. 50\u00a0\u03bcm) compared to that of commercial portable Raman spectrometers, and it has a modular design that allows for a wide variety of sampling configurations, including the use of several different laser wavelengths.In recent years, hyperspectral imaging and imaging spectroscopy have found numerous applications in the study and analysis of works on paper. It has been used for, amongst other applications, identifying stains on paper [18] and monitoring the condition of historic documents over time [19]. For artists\u2019 pigments, the value of hyperspectral scanning is to provide a digital image of the entire surface of an object, from which multiple analytical approaches can be taken (pseudo-colour mapping, principle component analysis and spectral angle mapping etc.). Delaney and others [11\u201313] have demonstrated the value of using both fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) together with imaging spectroscopy and hyper/multispectral imaging to visualise and map the location of pigments in objects as diverse as paintings by Picasso and medieval illuminated manuscripts. Hayem\u2013Ghez et al. [13] have also successfully demonstrated the validity of using hyperspectral pseudo-colour composites to differentiate between visually similar pigments. Therefore, the combination of portable Raman spectroscopy, FORS and XRF analysis together with Hyperspectral imaging can be considered a valuable and non-invasive system for the identification of historic watercolour pigments.\nFerdinand Bauer and the Flora Graeca\nAn enormous publishing endeavour, the Flora Graeca epitomised a change in character in the illustrated botanical book in the eighteenth century. It took 34\u00a0years to publish in its entirety, and was one of the most lavish and expensive books of its age.1 It is most remarkable however, for the magnificent illustrations that it contains, painted with astonishing beauty and accuracy by Ferdinand Bauer (1760\u20131826).\nJohn Sibthorp, Professor of Botany at Oxford met Bauer in Vienna, where he was working with the Naturalist and physician, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1786. Impressed with his skill, if not his temperament, he wrote to his travelling companion, John Hawkins, on the 3rd March 1786: \u2018My painter in each part of natural history is Princeps Pictorum. He joins to the Taste of the Painter the Knowledge of a Naturalist\u2014and animal, plant and Fossil touched by his hand shew the Master.\u2019 [20] Travelling from place to place quickly, often in difficult circumstances, Bauer was not able to carry with him large quantities of watercolour paper and other materials, nor would he have had the time to stop and prepare his colours to create full colour watercolour paintings for the many hundreds of specimens that he and Sibthorp collected.\nIn order to work in an efficient manner therefore, Bauer made simple graphite pencil sketches in the field, which were transformed into almost 1300 full scale watercolour paintings in Oxford between 1788 and 1794. In the field, he was unable to paint or record colour of these specimens directly. Crucial colour information was recorded solely by means of a complex numerical code applied to the sketches (Fig.\u00a01). Lack and others [1\u20133] have argued that it is highly likely that Bauer utilised a painted, numbered colour chart in conjunction with this code, while Mulholland [21, 22] has suggested that Bauer may have used the code rather more as a simple mnemonic device without the need for a physical chart.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nFerdinand Bauer, colour coded sketch for Iris germanicus, Graphite pencil on paper, 1786-7 (MS. Sherard 243/38) \u00a9 Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, 2017\n\n\nNo painted colour chart that can be reasonably attributed to Bauer exists (or has survived) for Bauer\u2019s numbered sketches after 1787. However, in 1999, Lack [1, 2] discovered what appears to be an early colour chart made by Ferdinand or his brother Franz Bauer in the archive of the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico in Madrid in which the numbered colours matched several early numbered sketches and paintings created by the brothers. The order of numbered colours on this chart however does not correlate to any of Bauer\u2019s paintings after 1787, and if painted colour charts ever existed for either the Flora and Fauna Graeca or the Bauer\u2019s later work, they have been lost.2 The Madrid chart therefore may have simply been an early experiment by the brothers to explore the accurate mixing of colours during their apprenticeship in the 1770s. The astonishing accuracy of Bauer\u2019s numerical colour code and his memory for colour is observed in the remarkable fact noted by Lack [1], that all but one of the 966 species Bauer painted for the Flora Graeca are painted with perfectly colour accuracy, and all are identifiable without any doubt (p156).3\n\n\nBauer\u2019s colour code\nBased on the evidence in the Madrid colour chart, Bauer may have developed a scheme of some 140 colours into one of at least 300 for the Flora Graeca, and from then into a considerably more complex scheme of 999 colours for his work on the Matthew Flinders expedition to Australia from 1801\u20131806, which was decoded by Mabberley in 1999 [5, 6]. How exactly Bauer used this colour system is unclear, but in the absence of a physical chart, by comparing the numerical codes to their painted versions of the sketches, the authors found that the codes for the Flora Graeca definitively corresponded to the same ordered scheme as his later Australian paintings. Table\u00a01 shows the basic ranges of colour by number code used by Bauer during his two botanical expeditions and that of the Madrid chart. Although the codes do not follow exactly the same pattern, the ordering of the colours by hue is similar in both the Flinders and Sibthorp numbering systems, but is markedly different in the unattributed painted colour chart form Madrid. Prior to this study it was unknown whether the pigments in the Madrid chart correlated with those found in later paintings [1\u20133].Table\u00a01\nSequence of colour codes used by Bauer from ca. 1775\u20131806\nMadrid/Haenke colour chart (ca. 1775\u20131786)\nNumber code\n\nColour range present in chart\n1\u201340Reds-oranges41\u201380Yellows81\u2013120Blues/lilacs121\u2013140GreensFlinders/investigator expedition to Australia (1801\u20131806)\nNumber code\n\nColour range observed in paintings\n1\u2013100Reds-dark reds101\u2013200Purples-pinks201\u2013300Pinks-mauves301\u2013400Lilacs-violets-blues401\u2013500Pale greens-greens501\u2013600Dark greens-yellow greens601\u2013700Yellows701\u2013800Oranges801\u2013900Browns901\u2013999Whites and blacksSibthorp expedition to eastern Mediterranean (1786\u20131787)\nNumber code\n\nColour range observed in paintings\n1\u201320Whites, greys blacks21\u201340Orange reds-dark reds41\u201380Dark reds, lilacs to light purples81\u2013120Blues121\u2013160Dark greens to yellow-greens161\u2013200Bright yellows to yellow-ochres201\u2013220Orange-yellows to brown-yellows221\u2013260Red-browns to dark-browns261\u2013280 (largely used in Fauna paintings)Transparent dark reds and purples281\u2013300\u00a0+\u00a0(largely used in Fauna paintings)Transparent greys and browns\n\n\nMethodsIn order to identify the pigments used in Bauer\u2019s paintings, watercolour mock ups were created based on a typical eighteenth century watercolour palette. Listed in Table\u00a02 (below), these were chosen based on the results of a survey of 73 painting manuals published from 1640 to 1860, which list pigments specifically recommended for watercolour and miniature painting. Pigments were obtained from Kremer Pigments GmBH, and were ground with a glass muller on a ground glass plate using gum Arabic, honey and water in an approximate 1:4 pigment binder ratio, depending on the pigment. The samples were painted out using a sable brush on a hand-made, gelatine-sized, off-white Barcham Green antique laid paper, similar to that originally used by Bauer for the Flora Graeca paintings, and a library of Raman and visible reflectance spectra was compiled. A number of 19th century pigments commonly used in watercolour (e.g. Alizarin crimson, ultramarine violet) were also added for comparison.Table\u00a02\nLaser activation wavelengths and laser power densities for laboratory-based Raman Spectrometers used\nSystemWavelength (nm)Laser power at sample (mW)Beam diameter (\u00b5m)Beam area (cm2)Power density (kW/cm\u22122)\nHoriba LabRAM HR4880.40.441.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\n270Horiba LabRAM HR5320.40.481.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\n220Horiba LabRAM HR6330.40.572.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\n150Horiba LabRAM HR7850.40.714.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\n100Renishaw inVia micro Raman8301.10.754.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\n249Bruker MultiRam1064501007.9E\u2212050.64Bruker MultiRam10641001007.9E\u2212051.27Bruker MultiRam10641501007.9E\u2212051.91Durham bespoke system633 and 5320.4501.96\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\n0.02\n\nRaman spectroscopy\nThe watercolour mock ups were analysed using three laboratory-based commercial Raman spectrometers at Northumbria University, Durham University and at the Rutherford Appleton Lab at the Harwell Campus, Didcot. These systems allowed the evaluation of six different laser excitation wavelengths: 488, 532, 633, 785, 830 and 1064\u00a0nm, to ascertain the optimum conditions for the library-based work (Table\u00a02).\nFor the 488\u00a0nm, 532\u00a0nm, 633\u00a0nm and 785\u00a0nm laser excitation wavelengths, a Horiba Jobin\u2013Yvon LabRAM HR confocal Raman microscope, equipped with a Peltier-cooled CCD and 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0LWD 0.55 NA Leica objective was used. The minimum sizes of the laser spot on the sample surface according to Abbe\u2019s law are 0.44, 0.48, 0.57, 0.71\u00a0\u00b5m respectively. The maximum power value of each laser source was reduced to approximately 0.4 mW at the sample using a neutral density filter. A 600\u00a0l/mm grating was used with all sources, except measurements made with the 488\u00a0nm laser. In this case, an 1800\u00a0l/mm grating was chosen to increase resolution. The minimum wavenumbers accessible were 200, 120, 70 and 100\u00a0cm\u22121 respectively for the 488, 532, 633 and 785\u00a0nm. Theses were determined by the edge filters used to inject the laser into the optical path of the spectrometer and remove the Rayleigh contribution. All acquisition operations were controlled by Lab Spec 6-Horiba Scientific software.\nThe 830\u00a0nm Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw micro-Raman spectrometer (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus, Didcot), equipped with a 830\u00a0nm diode laser, a silicon CCD detector and 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0LWD Leica objective lens. The resulting laser spot at the sample was 0.75\u00a0\u00b5m and the spectral range was 70\u20131800\u00a0cm\u22121 with a 1200\u00a0l/mm grating. The maximum laser power was 55\u00a0mW, attenuated to 1.1\u00a0mW at the sample. A silicon wafer was used as reference for calibration at 520\u00a0cm\u22121.\nThe 1064\u00a0nm Raman spectra were recorded using a Bruker MultiRam FT-Raman spectrometer at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus, Didcot, equipped with a 1064\u00a0nm Nd.YAG laser. The resulting laser spot at the sample was 100\u00a0\u03bcM. To achieve better results, samples were taken using laser powers adjusted to 50, 100 and 150\u00a0mW at the sample site, resulting in power densities of 0.64, 1.27 and 1.91\u00a0kW/cm\u22122 respectively.\nIn-situ Raman spectra were recorded on site at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico, Madrid and Natural History Museum, London using a dedicated spectrometer system optimised for the study of works on paper. The system employs a HeNe laser (632.8\u00a0nm, JDSU, 1 mW) attenuated using a neutral density filter, and focused into a fibre-optic cable for delivery to a Horiba Superhead sampling accessory. This is equipped with an ultra-long working distance\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040 microscope lens which also collects the backscattered Raman signal and provides a working distance of ca. 10\u00a0mm from the surface of the painting. The laser power at the sample was measured before each run and was maintained at\u00a0<\u00a00.4 mW. The laser spot on the sample is estimated ca. 50\u00a0\u03bcm diameter. However the apparent spot size using the fibre-delivery system is made considerably larger due to specular reflection from the surface of the object. As noted above, laser power density was calculated at 20\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122. The Raman signal is collected and passed down a second fibre optic cable to a spectrograph and cooled CCD camera (Andor Shamrock-163 and iDus416). The spectrometer control software was used to correct for the spectral response of the system and the wavenumber calibrated using a neon lamp. Spectra were typically the sum of 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0s acquisitions. For many samples that fluoresce (e.g. indigo), 1\u00a0s was the maximum integration time that could be used without saturating the sensor. For this reason, and to simplify data acquisition, 20 acquisitions were co-added to increase the signal to noise ratio for both fluorescent and non-fluorescent samples. The Raman sampling head was mounted on a vertical translation stage, itself mounted on a sliding rail fitted to a gantry that holds the head vertically over a single painting, or open bound volume, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nPortable Raman Spectrometer, designed and built at Durham University \u00a9 Durham University, 2017\n\n\nAccess to different regions of the object are achieved by sliding the head left and right along the gantry, or by moving the entire gantry backwards and forwards. Vertical adjustment of the sampling head allowed fine focus control of the sampling head to achieve optimum signal. A USB microscope (Veho) was also mounted on the sampling head, allowing an image of the area and the precise position of the laser spot on the painting to be captured. Raman spectra obtained from a green laser were recorded using a second Superhead, equipped with optics for operation at 532\u00a0nm and a fibre-coupled frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (Roithner Laser). This delivered\u00a0<\u00a00.4 mW at the sample and had a spot of 50\u00a0\u03bcm diameter, giving an average power density of 20\u00a0W\u00a0cm-2. The same spectrograph/camera as used for the 633\u00a0nm Superhead system was used for the acquisition of the Raman spectra.\n\nHyperspectral imaging\nHyperspectral scanning and visible/VNIR imaging reflectance spectroscopy was carried out using a Headwall E-series VIS/VNIR push\u2013broom system with a sensor covering a range of 380\u20131000\u00a0nm, and a scientific grade, non-UV filtered, f\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0mm lens was used. The sensor has a spatial resolution of 1600 pixels, an optical spectral resolution of 2.5\u20133\u00a0nm, and a spectral sampling interval of 0.64\u00a0nm, capturing a maximum of 972 individual wavelength bands for each pixel. For certain scans, a Headwall E-series high-efficiency VIS\u2013VNIR spectrograph was used, also covering the range 380\u20131000\u00a0nm, but capturing a maximum of 320 individual wavelength bands per pixel. The volumes were placed on a precision movable translation stage under a stationary quartz halogen EKE dichroic light source. The source emitted a maximum of 1000\u00a0lx at the surface, at average exposures of 3\u20134\u00a0s per cm and a typical total exposure per painting of 2\u00a0lx-hours at typical museum lighting conditions for the exhibition of works on paper (50\u00a0lx). A white and dark field calibration was carried out prior to every session. A diffuse white standard (Labsphere Inc.) was used to calibrate the instrument to apparent reflectance. Scanning was carried out at the highest spectral resolution so as to provide the highest quality data. Pseudo-colour rendering was carried out following the methodology published by Hayem-Ghez et al. [18], and three wavelengths were chosen that agreed with maximum differentiation between the particular pigments under consideration for each painting. Pseudo-colour rendering, spectral angle mapping and principle component analysis of hyperspectral images were carried out using two software packages: ENVI (Harris Geospatial Solutions) and Scyven (Scyllarus).\n\nX-ray fluorescence\nX-ray Fluorescence analysis on the bound Flora Graeca paintings was carried out using an Oxford Instruments X-MET 8000 series light element handheld XRF analyser with a 5\u00a0mm spot size. The instrument was run in air at 60\u00a0s acquisition times using the dual condition sets of 8, and 40\u00a0kV/8\u00a0\u00b5A so that a range of elements from magnesium to uranium could be detected. The same condition set and methodology was used for all analyses so that they are directly comparable. Longer exposure times were not possible due to the instrument being in handheld mode without a stand, and due to time restraints [23]. Analysis depth was in the region of 2\u00a0cm depending on the element, and therefore a non-fluorescing background plate was placed under the verso paper substrate so as not to pick up elements from the next painting in the volume. Due to the thin layer of the watercolour paint, elements from both the paint and paper substrate were inevitably included in the results. A measurement of the paper substrate from each page was taken and spectra from the paint and paper were overlaid in order to ascertain which elements derived from each component. Given the relatively large size of the beam, large areas of colour of measuring 5\u00a0mm in diameter or more were selected for analysis.\nOn site X-ray fluorescence of the unbound Madrid colour chart was carried out at the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico, Madrid by Dolores Gayo and Maite Jover de Celis from the Analytyical Laboratory, Museo Nacional Del Prado, Madrid using a Br\u00fcker Tracer III-SD handheld unit with a 3\u00a0mm spot size. Conditions were as noted above, with the exception that the instrument was run in a vacuum purge at 40\u00a0kV/20\u00a0\u00b5a with no filter and with an acquisition time of 60\u00a0s.\nOn site X-ray fluorescence on Bauer\u2019s unbound Australian orchid paintings was carried out by Robert McLeod at the Natural History Museum, London also using a Br\u00fcker Tracer III-SD handheld XRF unit. Conditions were as noted above, with the exception that the instrument was run in air using the dual condition set of 40\u00a0kV/10\u00a0\u00b5A with no filter and 40\u00a0kV/10\u00a0\u00b5A, and using a 12\u00a0mm Al\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0mm Ti +1\u00a0mm Cu filter for higher sensitivity to heavier elements. Acquisition time was 60\u00a0s.\n\nVis/NIR fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy\nFor the analysis of pigments on the Bauer/Haenke chart, the mobile Raman spectrometer described above was transported from the Bodleian Library to the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico in Madrid in February 2017. Raman spectroscopy was carried out as described above. In this case however, analysis was supplemented with visible and near infrared fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) for the identification of organic pigments and in particular for the presence of azurite. FORS was carried out using bespoke near infrared and visible FORS heads, designed and built at Durham University, which are attached to the adjustable Raman gantry described above together with the Raman Superhead. Both heads use a tungsten halogen light source. The visible FORS unit has a spectral range of 300\u20131100\u00a0nm, and the signal is acquired by an Ocean Optics Maya 2000 Pro spectrophotometer. The FTIR-FORS unit equipped with a FR-NIR spectrometer (Si-Ware, Neospectra) and has a spectral range of 1300\u20132600\u00a0nm. The adjustable gantry allows for both heads to be attached at the same time and the FORS heads have a stand off from the object surface of 8\u00a0cm (visible) and 4\u00a0cm (infrared). A diffuse white standard (Labsphere Inc.) was used to calibrate the instrument to apparent reflectance.\n\nResults and discussionTo determine the optimal parameters necessary for Raman spectroscopic analysis of the Bauer paintings, a range of pigment standards, described above, were investigated to determine which excitation wavelengths and laser power was most suitable for the paintings. Laboratory based instruments were utilised to establish optimum wavelength. Field spectra on the Bauer paintings were obtained using the 633\u00a0nm He-Ne laser as noted above. The study also established where the complimentary techniques (XRF, FORS and Hyperspectral imaging) could be best used to confirm the presence of pigments that had little or no Raman response at the power levels indicated.The data in Table\u00a03 shows the results obtained using laboratory-based commercial Raman spectrometers at Northumbria University, Durham University and at the Rutherford Appleton Lab at the Harwell Campus in Oxford. Although many pigments that exhibit good Raman scattering, such as vermillion, Prussian blue, red lead and ultramarine, yielded good spectra with all excitation wavelengths, the results confirmed that the green (532\u00a0nm) and the red (633\u00a0nm) lasers available in the Durham portable, in situ instrument produced consistently good results for a high proportion of the pigments (Table\u00a03). The 830 and 785\u00a0nm lasers also produced good results, but were not considered further as, due to the need to use increased laser power to obtain acceptable signal to noise ratios, conditions under which they produced excessive damage to both pigment samples and paper substrate. The results of the survey were also useful in determining that many common eighteenth century watercolour pigments that Bauer may have used (e.g. Brazilwood, madder lakes, sap green, and copper blues and greens) did not produce Raman spectra using any of the excitation wavelengths tested at power levels acceptable for the study of the paintings. Both the 633 and 532\u00a0nm lasers used in the Durham portable system produced good results for the modern watercolour standards. However, the 633\u00a0nm laser was selected. It was found to perform better with historical watercolours, and allowed the identification of the maximum number of pigments whilst being used at power densities well below the damage thresholds for the materials under study (Table\u00a04).\nTable\u00a03\nResults of survey of six Raman excitation lasers on watercolour pigments\n\n\n\nTable\u00a04\nNumber of pigments identified using different excitation wavelengths\nExcitation wavelength (nm)Pigments identified unequivocallyPigments identified with weak peaks or peaks obscured by fluorescence4881321532192563317267851219830183210641015\n\nIdentification of pigments in Ferdinand Bauer\u2019s watercolour paintings\nA total of one hundred and twenty-five paintings were analysed, comprising of ninety-seven from a single volume of the Flora Graeca (Ms. Sherard 242) and twenty-eight from two volumes of the Fauna Graeca (MS. Sherard 239: Pisces and MS. Sherard 240: Aves). For comparison, several of Bauer\u2019s later paintings made in Australia between 1801 and 1806 were analysed by XRF and Raman spectroscopy at the Natural History Museum in London. Additionally, the painted colour chart held at the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico and likely created by Bauer in Madrid was analysed by Raman spectroscopy, Vis and FTIR FORS and XRF. Samples were selected that were representative of the wide spectrum of colours used by Bauer. The results were recorded and compared, where possible, to the numerical codes on the field sketches. Tables\u00a05 and 6 show the pigments positively identified in all four sources. Results from the Flora Graeca were compared with those from the Fauna Graeca (Table\u00a05), and with seven paintings of orchids painted by Bauer from sketches made during his Australian expedition (Table\u00a06). Table\u00a07 provides a representative sample of analytical data from all four sources.Table\u00a05\nInstances of pigment use by Ferdinand Bauer in paintings for both the Flora and Fauna Graeca (1788\u20131794) from a total of 125 paintings\nPigments identified\nFlora Graeca (MS.

Naturally, greens were present in almost all paintings, and in several of the Fauna Graeca paintings. Unlike many contemporary watercolour painters, Bauer seems to have favoured pure copper greens (often adulterated with organic lakes and indigo), rather than a mixture of blue and yellow such as Prussian blue and gamboge known as Hooker\u2019s Green in watercolour, and widely used by artists at the time for painting foliage [24, 25]. Positive identification and differentiation of the particular type of copper green used (for example, verdigris, bice, chrysocolla/cedar green, malachite etc.) is not trivial by Raman spectroscopy using the 633\u00a0nm laser employed by the portable system, and spectra were obscured by large bands of fluorescence. However, under visual examination, the vast majority of Bauer\u2019s greens absorbed strongly in the ultraviolet and near-infrared regions, characteristic of copper-based pigments, and XRF analysis of a number of representative areas of green pigment confirmed the presence of copper in all cases. Microscopic examination at 400\u00d7\u00a0of the same examples indicated that Bauer rarely used a mixture of blue and yellow to provide green, so for example it is unlikely that he used a combination of copper blue and a yellow pigment. Several green pigments could not be identified using Raman spectroscopy or XRF. In these cases, it is possible Bauer used a green lake pigment such as sap green or terre verte (green earth), both of which are recommended frequently in eighteenth century watercolour manuals [26\u201329].\nAs expected, lead white is found throughout Bauer\u2019s work, both in white painted areas and, more commonly mixed with other pigments, identified using both Raman spectroscopy and XRF. Figures\u00a03 and 4 show typical XRF spectra for the presence of lead in red and blue painted areas of the Flora Graeca paintings. Although zinc white was a popular replacement for lead white amongst watercolourists, it was not in common use until the early nineteenth century. As noted below, Bauer appears to have abandoned lead white for the more transparent barium white in some later paintings.\n\nFig.\u00a03\n\ni. XRF spectra of red and orange pigments from MS.

Raman spectrum of MS. Sherard 239/43 with characteristic peaks for indigo. \u00a9 Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, 2017\n\n\nBoth Raman spectroscopy and XRF results confirm that Bauer used vermillion almost exclusively for his red colours (Fig.\u00a03), often tempered with an organic red lake, possibly cochineal/carmine or, less frequently, with red lead. Both vermillion and red lead were readily identified, but Raman spectroscopic results vary for the organic reds used, and in general identifiable peaks were obscured by fluorescence in all cases. However, visible reflectance spectra taken from the Madrid chart using FORS and from several Flora Graeca paintings using hyperspectral data produced characteristic absorbance bands for anthraquinones in several instances (500 and 560\u00a0nm with peak reflectance around 600\u00a0nm) [30], suggesting the presence of either madder or carmine, both recommended in most eighteenth century watercolour manuals [26\u201329]. Although it is occasionally possible to distinguish an insect (carmine, lac) or vegetable (madder) origin of anthraquinone-based red lake pigments in mock up samples, in this case the variation and quality of the spectra were not enough to identify these with confidence. However, the lack of madder\u2019s characteristic visible fluorescence under ultraviolet examination suggested carmine as the more likely. The few instances of pink colours analysed indicates that Bauer frequently used vermillion mixed with lead white or possibly madder mixed with lead white. Vermillion is present in almost all of Bauer\u2019s reds and also in mixture in many of his brown pigments. Red lead was identified in several orange colours but in general, when lighter reds/oranges were encountered, they were more commonly found to be a mixture of vermillion and an as yet unknown yellow pigment.\nYellow pigments from thirty-one paintings were analysed, but none produced a Raman spectrum. Inorganic yellows such as orpiment, realgar, massicot and Naples yellow were widely used in manuscript illumination, portrait miniature painting and botanical illustration prior to the late eighteenth century, and all four pigments are strong Raman scatterers. So the fact that no spectral evidence was found for any of these pigments strongly suggests that Bauer likely did not use them extensively. XRF analysis identified one instance where antimony was present (MS. Sherard 242/40) suggesting the use of Naples yellow (lead (II) antimonite) in at least one painting. However, it was not found in any other yellow pigment analysed from the Flora Graeca, Fauna Graeca, the Madrid chart or the Australian paintings. Traces of arsenic were also found in some examples suggesting the use of orpiment (arsenic (III) sulfide). However, the lack of the characteristic bands for orpiment in the Raman spectra, make this less likely. Furthermore, as Spring et al. [31] note, arsenic is frequently identified in conjunction with the blue pigment smalt, which was found to be present in significant amounts within the fibres of Bauer\u2019s paper substrate where it was used during the papermaking process as a \u2018blueing\u2019 agent, described below.4\n\nBauer\u2019s blues are dominated by two pigments: indigo and an unidentified copper blue. Analysis of several copper blue pigments identified with XRF in the Madrid colour chart confirmed the presence of azurite, characterized by NIR-FORS absorption bands at 2285 and 2352\u00a0nm. Indeed almost half of the blue swatches analysed in the chart were found to contain azurite. Although it is likely Bauer created this chart, there is no primary evidence to confirm this fact, and as NIR-FORS was not available at the time of the Flora Graeca pigment analysis, azurite has as yet to be positively identified in known painted works by Bauer after 1786. Indigo was identified by Raman spectroscopy in 72 paintings, and, as a means to outline areas, in almost all of the Flora paintings analysed (Fig.\u00a04ii). Bauer appears to have used indigo for particular purposes. He frequently used it to outline, delineate and define areas of a plant (he rarely used black pigments for this purpose), and he used it in admixture to manipulate the tone of other pigments. For example, indigo was identified as a component in almost all copper green pigments found in the Flora Graeca paintings and in several greens identified on the Madrid chart. Similarly, it was used together with vermillion or a red lake in most of Bauer\u2019s purples and in several of his browns.\nUnsurprisingly perhaps, indigo was rarely used to paint the striking, vibrant blues in the flowering bodies of certain plants given its relative lack of brilliancy in watercolour. Although not confirmed, the results provided by the Madrid colour chart, and characteristic absorption in the infrared region makes it seem likely that this was a copper blue such as azurite, bice or verditer. Since Bauer was required to paint almost 1300 paintings in colour at a rapid pace, the widespread use of indigo, which was considerably less expensive than azurite, smalt and particularly ultramarine, and a pigment that was very workable in watercolour would be an obvious choice [32, 33]. For the volume of paintings that Bauer was commissioned to produce for Sibthorp between 1786 and 1794, it is understandable that he made as much use of it as he could.5\n\nIn the Flora Graeca paintings examined, none of the more vibrant blues produced a Raman spectrum at the levels described above. However the absence of results for Raman-active blue pigments such as Prussian blue or ultramarine suggests that neither was preferred by Bauer for this purpose. Ultramarine was discovered in discrete areas in two of Bauer's later orchid paintings, produced during his later (and considerably better-funded) Australian expedition. Given Bauer's complaints [1, 3] about the meagre compensation paid to him by Sibthorp during the expedition to the Levant, it is perhaps understandable that using the extremely expensive ultramarine for a project involving almost 1300 paintings that were ultimately intended to be reproduced in print would have been prohibitive. However, the relative absence of the comparatively inexpensive Prussian blue in the Flora Graeca, in use as an artists\u2019 pigment by the 1720s and recommended highly in manuals on watercolour painting published throughout the second half of the eighteenth century, is notable [27, 28].\nRaman spectroscopy of several paintings of fish and birds from the Fauna Graeca paintings shows that Bauer used Prussian blue extensively in these works (Figs. 4ii,\u00a05). XRF analysis performed on site at the Natural History Museum in 2016 on blue pigments used in six paintings of Australian orchids by Bauer from the museum\u2019s collection, found that they contained no copper, but that potassium, iron, phosphorus and sulphur were present. These are indicative, if not conclusive, of Prussian blue. Other aspects however, strongly suggested the use of Prussian blue. Orange-yellow iron ferrihydrite deterioration observed throughout the blue pigment used for Epiblema grandiflorum (NHM Botany 173b)6 for example is consistent with the photo-oxidative deterioration of Prussian blue and with the results of artificial aging carried out on Prussian blue samples made according to traditional eighteenth century recipes by Samain et al. [33].7 Raman spectroscopy carried out on the same blue in 2017 however, confirmed only the presence of ultramarine, indigo and an unknown but highly fluorescent blue in these paintings (Table 7). Prussian blue was not found in any of the Orchid paintings analysed.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nRaman spectrum of MS. Sherard 239/43 with characteristic peaks for Prussian blue. \u00a9 Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, 2017\n\n\nXRF analysis revealed that in the majority of blues used in the Flora Graeca paintings copper and cobalt were present, suggesting the use of either smalt or a copper blue (such as blue bice, verditer or azurite) (Fig.\u00a04i). It is likely however, that the source of the cobalt in this instance was from the paper substrate itself. Under in situ microscopic examination at\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0400, it was clear that the particle morphology of Bauer\u2019s blue pigments was not consistent with smalt, while that of the blue pigment within the paper structure was. Bauer\u2019s blue pigment appears as small, finely divided, rounded and semi-opaque particles, in contrast with smalt (amorphous, conchoidally-fractured, angular and transparent particles). As noted above, particles matching this description and containing cobalt were clearly visible within the fibres in all instances of Bauer\u2019s papers examined under microscopy, suggesting that the source of the cobalt was likely the paper itself, rather than the blue pigment.\nA survey of Bauer\u2019s papers during the project demonstrated that he almost exclusively used high quality white, laid papers of Dutch origin. Almost all of these can be identified by their watermarks as papers from the mill of C&J Honig, imported in large quantities to England throughout the century.8 As demand for white paper increased, so did demand for quality, white linen rags [35]. Cheaper, lower quality rags were used for efficiency, but resulted in papers with a yellow tinge. To visually counteract this, \u2018blueing\u2019 agents in the form of dyes, blue textile rags and pigments were added to the paper at the pulp stage [34\u201336]. The use of smalt for this purpose was widespread in the eighteenth century, as very little pigment was required to tint or neutralise the tone of the paper [35]. The practice likely originated in the Netherlands, whose mills were highly regarded for their blue papers [34], and smalt has been positively identified in Dutch eighteenth century white papers in a number of studies [34, 36, 37]. The source of cobalt in Bauer\u2019s paintings is therefore more indicative of this practice, rather than the presence of smalt as a pigment. Furthermore, the presence of copper in almost all examples analysed by XRF, together with the positive identification of azurite in the earlier Madrid chart, strongly suggests that in addition to indigo, Bauer's tendency was to use copper blue pigments in his work.\n\nPigments in Bauer\u2019s Later Paintings (1801\u20131806)\nBauer\u2019s painting style changed markedly during and after his expedition to Australia with Matthew Flinders (1801\u20131806), and he favoured a more delicate watercolour style in transparent watercolour [1, 6, 38]. After 1800, Bauer largely abandoned the opaque painting technique he had used for the Flora Graeca paintings. Having more time to paint these at his leisure in Australia and after he returned to England in 1806, it is likely that he was able to spend more time on the more technically complex transparent watercolour technique. To do so also required a change to his pigment palette. Opaque pigments used in the Flora Graeca paintings such as lead white, red lead and vermillion were perhaps more suited to the bodycolour painting traditionally used in both manuscript illumination and portrait miniature painting [22, 26, 38]. XRF analysis carried out at the Natural History Museum in 2016 revealed that, at least in the small sample of paintings analysed, lead, copper and mercury were absent from Bauer\u2019s palette during these years. Pigments in the later paintings contained iron, aluminium, sulphur, potassium and barium, suggesting that he abandoned the use of the opaque copper greens and blues, vermillion, red lead and lead white used throughout the Flora Graeca in favour of more transparent laked pigments. As noted above, ultramarine, indigo and an unknown, transparent blue were found in several instances, but no red pigment used in these paintings produced a Raman spectrum. Furthermore, levels of iron in these pigments were only slightly higher than the paper background, largely ruling out the iron oxide reds, and suggesting Bauer's preference for organic red lakes at this time.\nThe presence of barium and absence of lead in these samples is notable. It suggests that Bauer likely used barium white (barium sulphate, barytes, blanc fixe, constant white, permanent white) as a replacement for lead white or as a transparent extender for his coloured pigments. Rejected by oil painters due to its lack of opacity in oil, barium white found favour with watercolourists in the late eighteenth century [24]. It is notable that James Sowerby, the London engraver who printed Bauer\u2019s paintings for the published Flora Graeca lists it in his book on colours in 1809 [39]. Indeed, the use of barium white remain almost entirely limited to watercolour until the 1820s, when it began to be used as an adulterant in the production of lead white [40]. Harley [24] notes that barium white was first described as an artists\u2019 pigment by Scheele in 1775, although it was certainly in use sporadically since the sixteenth century.\nIn artists\u2019 manuals, it is recommended specifically as a translucent white for watercolour painting as early as 1783 [28], and is cited as an excellent white for watercolour in Field\u2019s influential manual, Chromatography, as late as 1841 [41]. Eastaugh et al. [42] also note that Prussian blue was precipitated onto a barium sulphate substrate and sold under the name \u2018Brunswick blue\u2019 in the eighteenth century. This seems a likely explanation for the presence of barium in the blue pigments in these works. In general XRF analysis of these later works suggest that Bauer abandoned the opaque pigments from his earlier work in favour of more transparent lake pigments. This would be entirely consistent with a move towards the more delicate, transparent watercolour painting observed in these later paintings.\n\nHyperspectral mapping and pseudo-colour composites of Fauna Graeca paintings\nFor pigments that produced inconclusive results from a combination of Raman spectroscopy and XRF analysis, hyperspectral imaging was employed to differentiate and map visually similar pigments. Pseudo-colour rendering was chosen as it provided simple and rapid differentiation and mapping of certain pigments for the entire painted surface. The results were compared with those from spectral angle mapping and principle component analysis algorithms in ENVI. Following the methodology in Hayem-Ghez et al. [13], hyperspectral pseudo-colour images of red and blue watercolour pigment standards from the samples discussed above were rendered by identifying areas of their Vis/VNIR reflectance spectra showing the most significant differences. These were then compared to the hyperspectral images of two paintings by Bauer rendered to the same three wavelength bands: 593, 629 and 859\u00a0nm. Using the Headwall sensor and Scyven software, these bands and the resultant pseudo-colours for the Bauer mock up paint standards were found to be in agreement with the findings for the same pigments in an oil medium in Hayem-Ghez et al. [13] The high spectral resolution of the Bodleian Headwall sensor enabled discrete wavelength bands to be chosen to within 1.3\u00a0nm. Figures\u00a06 and 7 show the results of the hyperspectral pseudo-colour mapping of Naucratus ductor (MS. Sherard 239/43) and Labrus carneus (MS. Sherard 239/26) (Figs.\u00a06 and 7).\n\nFig.\u00a06\nFerdinand Bauer, Naucratus Ductor, Original (below), and hyperspectral pseudo-colour composite at 593, 629, 859\u00a0nm (above). MS.

Sherard 239/26. \u00a9 Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, 2017\n\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of Naucrates ductor identified three different blues used in the image; indigo, Prussian blue and an as yet unidentified highly fluorescent pigment, likely a copper blue. However, due to the apparent visible laser spot size, not having the ability to image the area through a microscope lens, and the extremely finely painted lines of the blue scales over other areas of blue often made it difficult to isolate precise areas of blue from others, particularly where one blue was applied over another or where pigments may have been mixed. Maximising the difference in the reflectance spectra of known samples of copper blues (azurite, bice and verditer), indigo and Prussian blue, and comparing this to the hyperspectral pseudo-colour image of the painting allowed the mapping of the locations of these three pigments. Figure\u00a06 shows that in the pseudo-colour image, areas of indigo appear red, the copper blues appear purple and Prussian blue appear black. Principle component analysis and spectral angle mapping were performed, and provided results that were consistent with the pseudo-colour rendering, further suggesting that four different blues may have been used in the painting and providing much clearer visual map of the location of these paints.\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of Labrus carneus identified vermillion and red lead, which were present throughout the painting together with another unidentified red pigment used to paint the scales throughout the body. The analysis also demonstrated that Bauer generally used red lead, red lead mixed with vermillion, red lead mixed with a yellow pigment or vermillion mixed with a yellow pigment in order to produce orange in the Fauna Graeca paintings. The oranges used in Labrus carneus all appear visually similar. However, as above, it was difficult to isolate the exact location of areas painted with each pigment with Raman spectroscopy and XRF alone.\nThe pseudo-colour image in Fig.\u00a07 shows the mapping of areas of vermillion (appears yellow) and red lead (appears transparent). The main body of the fish appears to be painted in red lead alone with no vermillion. The dorsal and pectoral fins and areas of the gills and eye clearly contain vermillion, whereas the pelvic fin appears to be painted in red lead. The tips of the dorsal and pectoral fins appear purple in the pseudo-colour image, indicating a copper blue. The scales however appear to be painted in a red lake. The light red/pink colour of the red used in the delineation of the scales in the pseudo-colour image and subsequently confirmed by Raman spectroscopy suggests this contained neither vermillion nor red lead and was likely to be an organic lake pigment. In this case the pseudo-colour appears similar to that of lac, madder or brazilwood lakes, but not to that of carmine/cochineal. It is important to note that what was sold as \u2018red lake\u2019 by colourmen and apothecaries in the eighteenth century often referred to a number of materials\u2014cochineal and brazilwood among them [27\u201329]. A 1738 manual states for example that \u201c[Red] Lake is to be had in most colour shops ready prepared in shells for water-colours\u201d [26].\n\nConclusionThis study has demonstrated through the analysis of approximately ten percent of Bauer\u2019s paintings for the Flora Graeca using non-invasive, in situ methods, that Bauer used a fairly simple and traditional palette for the period, and that together with his colour code system, he used a relatively small number of pigments to achieve almost perfect colour fidelity in his work. It has determined that Bauer largely favoured a pure (copper-based) green adulterated with indigo for his foliage, rather than a mixture of blue and yellow pigments, unusual for the time It has also shown that the Madrid colour chart was created using a very similar palette, and although Bauer cannot be definitively credited as its creator, the pigment data adds to an existing body of historical information that provides convincing evidence that this is likely. From the limited analysis performed on his later paintings, it is clear that Bauer\u2019s pigment use changed as he evolved toward the more time consuming and technically challenging transparent watercolour painting style where he abandoned more opaque pigments such as vermillion, copper blues and greens, red lead and lead white in favour of more transparent pigments.Finally, the study demonstrates that while there are clear limitations in using in situ, non-destructive analytical techniques to characterise the materials and techniques of an artists\u2019 oeuvre, portable Raman spectroscopy, FORS, portable XRF and hyperspectral imaging are valuable and complimentary techniques that can provide important data from watercolour paintings. It shows that good results can be obtained from Raman spectroscopy using laser powers that are well below the threshold that might otherwise damage photochemically sensitive pigments, and that hyperspectral pseudo-colour composites can be a useful technique for mapping areas of pigment use over a large area and for the differentiation of visually similar pigments, one that has much potential for future work. The data provides an insight into Bauer\u2019s technique, his process, and how he was able to achieve such an impressive degree of fidelity and accuracy in his work. Perhaps more importantly however, the results of this study enabled the creation of a physical reconstruction of Bauer's Flora Graeca colour chart. Recreated by the authors using traditional watercolour pigments that were identified in Bauer's work during the study, this chart was exhibited to the public at the Bodleian in the Summer of 2017, allowing visitors to see\u2014for the first time\u2014a visual representation of what Bauer's \u2018lost\u2019 colour chart may have looked like.\nFootnotes1Harris notes that in 1830, twenty-five subscribers paid 620\u00a0lb for a complete copy of the Flora Graeca, roughly twenty times the average annual wage in England at the time. [4].\u00a02HW Lack carried out extensive research on Bauer\u2019s work over a period of 40\u00a0years, and in this time no colour chart has been discovered and no written reference to Bauer\u2019s use of a colour chart in the field for either the Sibthorp expedition (1786\u20131787) or the Flinders expedition to Australia (1801\u20131806).\u00a03After comprehensive analysis, Lack found only one minor colour error in the 966 Flora Graeca paintings. Bauer\u2019s depiction of Anchusa cespitosa (MS Sherard 244 f35), is coloured grey\u2013blue where it should have been a deep, striking blue [1] p. 156.\u00a04The physical appearance of Bauer\u2019s yellows with microscopy, and under ultraviolet and hyperspectral examination when compared to known standards, seems to indicate that he generally used two different yellows. The appearance of these under microscopy and with visual comparison under discrete hyperspectral wave bands, appears to be consistent with yellow ochre, yellow lake and gamboge.\u00a05There are no extant records from either the Sibthorp or Flinders expeditions that document the purchase of artists\u2019 materials. However, it is highly likely that Bauer was responsible for purchasing his own materials from his own salary. The fact that very expensive pigments such as ultramarine or cochineal were not used or were used in very limited cases in the Flora Graeca paintings is likely due to Bauer\u2019s limited financial resources and the vast number of paintings he was required to produce within a very limited time period.\u00a06Library and Archive, Natural History Museum, London: \u2018Forty-nine original water colour drawings of the Animals, and 252 of the Plants, which were collected when accompanying the Voyage under Capt. M. Flinders to Australia.\u2019\u00a07There are reports of the deterioration of Prussian blue from the nineteenth century onward. Samain et al. [32] found that a bright orange iron ferrihydrite was formed on prepared samples of Prussian blue after accelerated light aging at 400\u00a0h at 90,000 lux. Significantly this only occurred on samples prepared to traditional eighteenth century recipes. Modern, commercially available Prussian blue pigments were not affected in the same manner. An experiment carried out by the authors in 2016 in which modern Prussian blue watercolour mock ups were exposed to 6\u00a0months of daylight agreed with these findings.\u00a08The Honig paper mill was formed in 1662 at Wormer by Cornelius Jan Honig. It was enlarged and moved to Zaandijk in 1668, becoming one of the most important paper mills in the Netherlands in the eighteenth century. It continued under successive generations of the Honig family until 1854, when it was sold to Gerbrand der Jong and enveloped into his company.\u00a0Abbreviations\nFTIR:\u00a0\nFourier Transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nFORS:\u00a0\nfibre optic reflectance spectroscopy\n\nXRF:\u00a0\nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy\n\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsRM, DH, AB, CN and KD contributed to the conception of the study and acquisition and analysis of the data.

A reference collection of 178 Chinese papers, dating from 1799 to 1990 was used, and properties such as pH, degree of polymerisation (DP), lignin content, and tensile strength (zero-span) were determined. Most of the papers were of approximately neutral pH, had a low lignin content and DP similar to pre-19th century European rag paper. It was found that the high inhomogeneity and the typical paper thinness affected tensile testing and as a result, a modified method for zero-span tensile strength test was developed. Using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), proof-of-concept partial least squares (PLS) applications were developed for determination of tensile strength, pH, DP and for dating of the samples. For the latter, using post-1900 papers, the error of cross validation was 13\u00a0years. The presence of lignin was modelled using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), where the model could distinguish between high and low lignin content with 88% accuracy. Using one or multiple sheets for transmission NIR spectroscopy led to PLS results of similar quality, which was attributed to material inhomogeneity.KeywordsNear infrared spectroscopyChemometricsNon-destructiveTensile strengthDatingConservationArchivesLibraries\nIntroductionMany libraries, archives and museums house significant Chinese paper collections. However, there have been limited studies into the material composition of this paper type; it has been common to focus on European papermaking practices at least in Western studies [1, 2]. Compared to European paper, paper from the sino-japanese cultural realm remains relatively less known. For the purpose of this research, Chinese paper is defined as any paper originating from China.As papermaking spread through China it became a highly competitive and regionalised practice, and papermakers relied heavily on local vegetation for raw materials. Individual recipes by local mills differed, creating a non-standardised and often secretive industry, as these recipes were not shared [1, 3, 4]. Adding to this, the end use of the paper would often determine its material properties i.e. the fibres used, amount of impurities left in the paper, or finishing. As a result, there is a significant lack of understanding of the material properties of historic Chinese paper within the generally accessible science and conservation literature. Yet, such information could significantly improve our understanding of the history of this craft and of the care of Chinese paper collections.Conversely, the general practice of papermaking in China is well documented [1, 5\u20138]. The raw materials varied regionally, and many plants were used for manual papermaking; including hemp, paper mulberry, cotton, ramie, rattan, flax, bamboo, jute, rice, wheat straw, and blue sandalwood. From the early 20th century on, both wood pulp and traditional fibres have been used for machine made papers. The papermaking process and stock preparation varied between mills, but impurities, like bark, were generally removed by hand while pulping was manual or semi-mechanical, using machines similar to Hollander beaters. Dispersion aids, often the root extract of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik [9], and additives, such as kaolin, wood ash or lime [1] were added to the pulp mix prior to sheet formation. Surface sizing was not common.It is known that Chinese papermaking industry did not follow Western industrialisation in the 19th century, and did not rely on the same raw materials [10]. The time period of particular interest to this research is the 19th and 20th century, a period of change, where advancing technologies enabled a shift from handmade to mass produced machine paper. In addition, the period of interest includes the Cultural Revolution in China (1966\u20131967), where there was a strong promotion of industrialisation that introduced lasting changes to the papermaking industry [10]. This may have had an effect on the material stability, though no research is currently available.Paper is a relatively stable organic material; however, its main structural component cellulose undergoes a series of degradation processes [11]. These depend on environmental conditions as well as on material composition [12]. Within this study, traditional destructive analysis was carried out to explore pH, degree of polymerisation (DP), zero-span tensile strength and lignin content. Standardised characterisation methods were used such as cold extraction for pH, viscometry to determine DP, and the phloroglucinol spot test for semi-quantitative determination of lignin content. A modified method for zero-span tensile testing was developed to allow for the typically low grammage of Chinese paper. Finally, 178 samples from the UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage Historic Reference Material Collection were dated based on textual analysis.While these results represent a systematic material study of the chemical and physical properties of a selection of modern Chinese papers, the destructive character of the chemical analytical methods precludes their use in collections of historic value. Many non-destructive techniques have been used in historic paper research: of the Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) sampling techniques, attenuated total reflectance is often used, however, the requirement to apply pressure during a measurement makes it unsuitable for fragile objects. Raman spectroscopy can be very useful for ink and pigment analysis [13] or characterisation of lignin and cellulose degradation products [14]. However, the often low signal-to-noise ratio and fluorescence make it less suitable as a general characterisation technique. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) is widely used for elemental analysis; however, it is routinely used only for elements heavier than silica [15] and it does not provide any useful information on the organic components of paper.Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) in conjunction with multivariate data analysis has been successfully applied to determination of properties such as pH, degree of polymerisation (DP), lignin content, mechanical properties and age in European and Islamic papers [16\u201318] and quantitative imaging applications have been developed [19]. NIR spectra contain fewer specific spectral features than mid-IR, as overtone and combination bands overlap, making band assignment challenging. However, using chemometrics, quantitative information can be extracted, resulting in a portable, non-destructive and reasonably affordable alternative to many other spectroscopic techniques. Due to the significant differences in the composition of European and Chinese paper, specific NIR methods may need to be developed in order to enable this type of spectroscopy to be used in systematic surveys of Chinese library and archival collections.In this research, we explore the material properties of a large selection of modern Chinese paper to shed light on their composition, specifically in view of their stability and potential conservation issues. We use a reference collection for this purpose as destructive sampling was required. However, we also explored the potential for development of non-destructive NIR methods, which would allow us to explore historically significant collections in the future.\nMaterials and methodology\nSamples\nThe UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage Historic Reference Material Collection of Chinese paper was used (Fig.\u00a01). The samples were selected on the basis of age, size, method of production (handmade or machine-made), as well as diversity, such that they represented the evolving paper production industry within 19th and 20th century China. Within the sample set, 110 papers were visually assessed as handmade and 68 papers as machine-made. The dates are considered as approximate, particularly for samples obtained from antique shops, unless the samples themselves contained a date. In total, 178 papers, ranging from ~\u00a01800 to 1990 (Fig.\u00a02), were used.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nTwo typical samples of handmade paper from the reference collection\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a02\nDistribution of dates within the reference collection\n\n\nTo reduce measurement uncertainty, samples were not taken from within a 1-cm wide margin of a document. Similarly, areas containing ink, stains or mould were not used.\n\npH\nAcidity was measured following the TAPPI T\u00a0509 standard [20], with previously suggested modifications [21]: 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mg sample was extracted in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of distilled water and soaked overnight. A Mettler Toledo SevenGo pH/Ion Meter (Columbus, OH) with a micro-combined glass electrode was used. For calibration, Mettler Toledo pH 4.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and pH 9.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 buffers were used at room temperature. The sample was removed from the solution prior to measurement. Values were rounded to the nearest \u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0pH unit. The typical measurement uncertainty was 1\u201311%. 178 papers were measured in triplicate and the measurements were averaged.\n\nDegree of polymerisation\nThe standard viscometric method was used (BS ISO 5351:2004 [22]). 20\u00a0mg of paper was dissolved in 20\u00a0ml of solution, consisting of 10\u00a0ml cupriethylenediamine (CED) and 10\u00a0ml deionised water. The efflux time of a solution was measured in triplicate at 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 0.01\u00a0s accuracy. Furthermore, triplicate samples of 20 papers were measured to determine the average measurement uncertainty, which was 10\u201315%. For comparison, the measurement uncertainty for DP of Whatman No 1 filter paper (Maidenhead) was determined to be 1%.\nSubsequently, to save resources, two separate samples were tested from the rest of paper samples. If the variance between the two samples was greater than the previously observed maximum uncertainty (15%), a third sample was measured and the average was calculated. 22 samples were thus additionally measured in triplicate. Out of these, the Dixons q-test at a 90% level of confidence was used to determine two individual outlier measurements.\nThe limiting viscosity number was determined using the Wetzel-Elliot-Martin\u2019s equation [23], with the moisture content assumed to be 5%, as due to limited sample availability it was not possible to determine it accurately. Similarly, ash content could not be determined, however, since none of the papers contained fillers as contemporary Western papers do, this is not considered to be a major source of error. The Mark\u2013Houwink-Sakurada equation was used to calculate DP [24].\nThe method is not suitable for lignin-containing papers due to lack of solubility. In 20 handmade papers, bark-like tissue was removed from the sample. These impurities, rare and local, could affect the properties of paper locally, but not at the level of a paper sheet, and were not soluble in CED. DP was determined for 94 papers that tested negatively using the phloroglucinol test.\n\nLignin content\nThe presence of lignin was determined using the phloroglucinol spot test according to the standard procedure (TAPPI T\u00a0401 [25]). Colour change was assessed on a 3-point scale. 0\u2014no colour change, 1\u2014<\u00a01/4 of fibres exhibiting colour change, 2\u2014>\u00a01/4 of fibres exhibiting colour change. 178 papers were tested.\n\nThickness\nThree to five measurements were taken for each paper using a digital caliper (0.001\u00a0mm readability). Dixons q-test, at a 90% level of confidence was performed to determine two outlier measurements. 178 papers were tested.\n\nTensile strength properties\nTensile strength was measured using the zero-span method (BS ISO 15361:2000 [26]), modified by using a Zwick Roell tensile strength instrument BT1-Fr0.5TS.D14 (Ulm, Germany) with custom-made zero span clamps. Several parameters were modified: the strip length was optimised to best fit the clamps without using excess material (Fig.\u00a03), while the sample orientation followed previous research where zero-span was used to measure Western handmade papers [27]. Only 45 samples were available in a quantity large enough that 12 measurements could be performed (84\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018\u00a0cm).\n\nFig.\u00a03\nThe position of the modified clamps and paper used in zero-span measurements\n\n\nSeveral strip lengths were tested: 60\u2013100\u00a0mm. 70-mm strips were the shortest strips that could be repeatably positioned in the clamps. The z force (N) and strain (mm) of twelve 70\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0mm strips were measured for each tested paper. The highest and lowest values were excluded from calculation of the average, which was corrected for paper grammage to calculate zero-span tensile strength index, following the standard.\n\nSpectroscopic analysis\nNIR measurements were performed using a Polychromix\u00a0PHAZIR\u2122-1624 Handheld NIR Analyzer (Wilmington, MA), equipped with a tungsten light source, and an InGaAs detector. Reflectance spectra were collected in the wavelength interval of 1600\u20132400\u00a0nm, one sample point per document, with 9 averaged spectra, at 11-nm resolution. For single-sheet measurements, the sampling point was chosen such that it was near the sampling area for chemical and mechanical characterisation, while for 5-sheet measurements this was not possible to ensure. All the measurements were performed at 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u201345% RH. The white calibration cap was used as a back reflector. 178 samples were measured.\n\nMultivariate data analysis\nPartial least squares (PLS) regression was performed using the Polychromix Model Generator software (Wilmington, MA) to develop applications for pH, date, and DP determination. Samples were randomly allocated into calibration and validation sets. The calibration set comprised of 2/3 of the observations, and independent full validation was performed using the remaining samples as a validation set. Due to the small number of samples, only calibration was carried out for zero-span tensile strength. Different spectral processing calculations were tested: a combination of either multiplicative scatter correction or standard normal variate, and first or second order Savitzky\u2013Golay algorithm with a three or five-point window was used depending on the model (Table\u00a02). The wavelength interval was kept at 1600\u20132400\u00a0nm. The number of factors was optimised using the validation set.\nThe root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for each model was calculated using $${\\text{RMSEP}} = \\sqrt {\\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} (y_{i - } \\hat{y}_{i} )^{2} }}{n}},$$where y\n\ni\n is the measured and \\(\\hat{y}_{i}\\) is the predicted value.\nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed using XLStat (Addinsoft, Paris) for lignin data classification, while the pre-processing of the spectral data was performed in Mathworks\u00a0Matlab (Natick, MA). As above, samples were randomly allocated into training and validation sub-sets. Different spectral processing calculations were tested on both sub-sets in Matlab; first derivative with a window width of 5, with either multiplicative scatter correction or standard normal variate. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed in Matlab to acquire the principal component scores [28]. The papers were classified according to their lignin content on the basis of their principal component scores in XLStat. As the measure of accuracy, the percentage of correctly classified samples (% correct in Table\u00a01) was used. Within-class covariance matrices were assumed to be equal, prior probabilities were not taken into account. Separate method validation was performed using the validation sub-set and the number of factors was optimised based on % correctly classified samples.Table\u00a01\nTraining, validation, and cross-validation matrices for the best performing LDA models for identification of lignin, using 5 sheets (above) and 1 sheet (below)\nLDA modelTrainingValidationCross-validationLow (0/1)High (2)Total% correctPre-processingLow (0/1)High (2)Total% correctLow (0/1)High (2)Total% correctLow (0/1)7198089\nf\u2019(\u03c7), SNV, 4 PC scores430431007198089High (2)42428863811734242886Total7533108884685494753310888Low (0/1)7288090\nf\u2019(\u03c7), MSC, 5 PC scores42143987198089High (2)424288611011915232882Total76321088943115496763210887\nWhen calculating first derivative (f\u2019(\u03c7)), the window width of 5 was used\n\n\n\nResults and discussionThe distribution of the properties in the sample set validates many of the statements about material properties in the available secondary Chinese paper literature. Where available, paper thickness, pH, DP, lignin content and zero-span tensile strength were plotted against paper production date (Figs.\u00a04, 5). The pH values are generally >\u00a06 well into the 20th century, which confirms the known absence of use of acidic sizing, as well as low lignin content in both handmade and machine-made papers [29]. The pattern of DP tends towards higher values with age, which indicates a gradual change in fibre pre-treatment or raw material with time, with lower quality fibres having been used in later periods. Machine made papers were observed mainly after 1950, when chemical removal of lignin became regular practice in industrial papermaking [30, 31], but it is known that wood pulp was also imported to China from mid-20th century on [31]. Papers with high lignin content were not present in the sample set until 1946, and all were machine made. There is an equal distribution of low lignin content papers throughout the period as papermaking by hand was popular until mid-1960s and early machine-made papers were often made using fibres of naturally low lignin content, as well as chemically delignified fibres (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nFig.\u00a04\npH, DP, thickness, zero-span tensile strength vs. date. Black circles indicate machine made papers and white circles indicate handmade papers\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a05\nBoxplots of date vs. lignin content. '0' on the left, '1' in the middle, '2' on the right\n\nThe measurements of zero-span tensile strength show a gradual decrease with age, which is in an interesting contrast with DP measurements. This indicates that tensile properties differently depend on intra- and inter-fibre bonding in handmade and machine-made papers.Another specific property of the characterised collection of Chinese paper samples is low grammage. Figure\u00a06 shows that handmade papers are biased towards lower thicknesses. The observed variability in thickness is higher than that for Western papers from the same period: 19th century handmade European papers have a thickness between 0.07 and 0.14\u00a0mm [27], whereas handmade papers from the sample set have a thickness between 0.01 and 0.17\u00a0mm. 20th century Western machine-made papers have a thickness between 0.08 and 0.18\u00a0mm [1], whereas machine-made papers from the sample set measured 0.03 and 0.014\u00a0mm. For determination of thickness, handmade papers exhibited higher RSD (3\u201383%) than machine-made papers (1\u20139%) for individual samples, which demonstrates higher dimensional homogeneity in industrial machine-made papers.\n\nFig.\u00a06\nThickness distributions for handmade (left) and machine-made papers (right) in the reference collection\n\nIt is important to note that handmade Chinese papers are also compositionally inhomogeneous, which was evident from the high analytical uncertainties as observed for a number of measured properties. Paper thickness and homogeneity are important for this research as they affect the repeatability of spectra and thus reliability of multivariate data analysis, and may also affect the local stability of paper.\nChemical properties\n\npH\nPaper acidity/alkalinity is a crucial parameter regulating the mechanisms and defining the rates of degradation of cellulose [12]. Overall, the pH of the reference collection averaged at 7.6 (Fig.\u00a07), with only a few handmade samples having pH\u00a0<\u00a06. The usual causes of acidity within paper are well-known: alum/rosin sizing, lignin (causing acidity due to oxidation), residual chemicals from papermaking processes, and air pollutants [21].\n\nFig.\u00a07\nDistribution of pH of handmade (left) and machine-made papers (right) in the reference collection\n\n\nThere is little evidence within the papermaking literature of alum sizing or additives being used in 19th and 20th century Chinese papermaking. Dispersion aid derived from the mucus of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik was commonly used [9], but this does not appear to influence pH [32, 33]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, handmade papers made from \u2018traditional\u2019 paper mulberry, bamboo, and bast fibres such as flax, were widely used in mass production. These fibres have a relatively low lignin content, compared to wood pulp used in Europe [29]. Traditionally, chemical bleaching was not used for handmade papers in China; instead, sun bleaching during drying was common [1]. The distribution of pH thus does not follow that of 19th and early 20th century Western paper, where 70\u201380% of paper produced between 1850 and 1990 are acidic [16, 34].\nThere are only a few papers with pH\u00a0<\u00a05 in the sample set. It is known that as the papermaking process became more industrialised during the mid-20th century, Western practices started to permeate the industry [10, 30] which could contribute to the lower pH values. Canadian wood pulp, mixed with traditional fibres was introduced mid-20th century to some Chinese production mills. Chemical bleaching and lignin removal was also introduced during this time [31] and it is also possible that Western acidic paper was imported to China.\nHandmade papers exhibited a significant variance in pH measurements, which is ascribed to inhomogeneous fibre distribution and localised compositional differences. The RSD for measurements of the same sample was up to 20% (0.8 pH units), which is high in comparison with Western paper, where values of 0.3 are typically observed [21]. The observed high variance could lead to significant differences in degradation locally. As well as this, high RSD may affect the quality of the PLS model, as we will explore later.\n\n\nLignin content\nDue to oxidation, lignin leads to low colour stability of paper [35]. The amount of lignin in paper depends on the raw material and the paper making process [36]. Using the phloroglucinol test, colour change was visually observed in 105 samples, whereas 73 papers did not exhibit any noticeable colour change (Fig.\u00a08).\n\nFig.\u00a08\nDistribution of lignin content of both handmade and machine made papers in the reference collection\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a09\nDistribution of DP for machine-made (left) and handmade paper samples (right)\n\n\nMany handmade papers exhibited colour change restricted to individual fibres, indicating mixtures of lignin-free and ligneous fibres. In some handmade papers, clusters of lignin-containing fibres were found, which could result in localised degradation and yellowing in the future. Homogeneous colour change was observed in 15 papers, indicating that such paper was likely made wholly from bamboo or wood-derived pulp.\n\n\nDegree of polymerisation\nDP influences mechanical properties [37] and is thus an important measure of its fitness for use. It is also an important variable in the damage function for historic paper [12, 38, 39].\nAs papers with a high lignin content cannot be dissolved in cupriethylenediamine, a number of samples (83) from the reference collection could not be measured. Prior to DP determination, localised fibre clusters and other impurities (e.g. remains of bark) were removed from some samples in order to improve dissolution. However, this could have affected the measured DP values as well as multivariate data analysis.\nThe mean DP values for handmade and machine-made papers are 1860 and 1240 respectively (Fig.\u00a09). These values resemble the DP of pre-1850 European rag paper, which ranges between 810 and 3800 [37, 40]. Few traditional papermaking techniques reported in East Asia utilised oxidising, highly alkaline or highly acidic chemicals, with the exception of the use of caustic soda [32, 33], which could result in pH values above 9, which was not observed in our study (Fig.\u00a07). Due to the lack of solubility, less DP data is available for machine-made papers, although this compares favourably with that of 20th century European machine-made papers, which ranges between 200 and 1500 [37, 41].\n\nFig.\u00a010\nDistribution of zero-span tensile strength for the measured samples from the Chinese reference paper collection (N\u00a0=\u00a045)\n\n\nIn relation to the method, the observed inhomogeneous fibre distribution and localised impurities in handmade papers created significant variance of >\u00a0200 DP, i.e. >\u00a015% RSD was observed for triplicate measurements of the same sample, in 20 samples. The high RSD may affect the reliability of multivariate data analysis, as we will explore later.\n\n\nMechanical properties\n\nZero-span tensile strength\nPreliminary tearing tests have shown that handmade Chinese papers have low inter-fibre bonding but high fibre strength. As the zero-span test is a widely accepted method of measurement of fibre strength within a sheet [42], it was the method of choice, although the role of inter-fibre bonding in this property is still not fully understood [43]. Another criterion for this choice was that smaller samples are needed, compared to tensile strength testing.\nIn previous research on Western rag paper [27], it was concluded that measuring parallel to chain lines yielded higher values in the majority of papers due to the grain direction created by the action of the mould going into the vat during sheet formation. Our own measurements confirmed this, however, there was a higher variance between measurements. It was observed that in many papers there was an increased concentration of fibres along chain lines, which led to higher variance.\u00a0It was therefore decided to measure parallel to laid lines, 5\u00a0mm from the nearest chain line, to exclude areas with inhomogeneous pulp deposits. The results are reported in tensile index (kNm/kg) a measure of inherent strength in the paper (Fig.\u00a010). As a methodology has been developed in this research project, there is no directly comparable data available; however, contemporary softwood kraft paper has been found to have a lower tensile index between 90 and 120\u00a0kNm/kg [44]. Machine-made papers were found to have a higher zero span tensile index on average. This could be the result of additives or sizing, e.g. the addition of starch into the pulp is known to yield higher values for paper made from softwood fibres [45]. There was no correlation between thickness and zero-span tensile strength (R\n\n2\n\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Previous research established a correlation between DP and mechanical properties of paper [46]; however, our results do not confirm this for zero-span tensile strength of Chinese paper (R\n\n2\n\u00a0=\u00a00.08).\n\nFig.\u00a011\nSlopes (left) and correlation\u00a0coefficients (right) for linear correlations obtained for absorbance values for 1\u20139 paper layers compared per wavelength with the values obtained for 10 layers of the same paper\n\n\n\n\nNear infrared spectroscopy\nWhile NIR methods have successfully been developed for characterisation of 19th and 20th century European paper [16, 17], the results discussed above show that the significantly different properties of Chinese paper might require specific methods to be developed. Due to the low grammage of Chinese paper, a study of the required number of layers of paper was carried out first to obtain a spectrum without the influence of the \u00a0Additional file 1\u00a0as was done for European paper [16].\nThe spectra of 1\u201310 layers of paper were measured for 4 paper samples of different thicknesses (sample nos. 48B, 54, 33B, 76). The spectra of 1\u20139 paper layers were compared with the spectrum obtained for 10 layers of the same paper, by correlating absorbance values pairwise per wavelength (Fig.\u00a011). The data demonstrates that at ~\u00a05 layers the values R\n\n2\n tend to level-off at >\u00a00.99, while the slopes are mostly >\u00a00.8. Thus, 5 layers of paper were explored as a suitable number of layers enabling successful multivariate data analysis. However, since in practice it might be difficult to fold an archival document into 5 layers, spectra using 1 layer were also measured and used for data analysis. From further analysis, 3 samples were removed as there was not enough material to perform 5-layer measurements, and a total of 173 samples were thus included in multivariate data analysis.\n\nFig.\u00a012\nPredicted vs. actual values for PLS calibrations and validations using 5 (left) and 1 (right) layers of paper. Black circles indicate calibration results and hollowed circles indicate validation results. The calibration (dark dotted line) and validation (light dotted line) data were fitted using linear regression\n\n\nPrior to multivariate data analysis, PCA was performed on the spectra to determine any outliers. 2\u00a0samples were found to have significantly different spectra from the rest. Visual assessment showed that the samples contained pink and brown dyes. As these samples represented exceptions and as the focus of this research is not to assess the properties of coloured papers, the samples were removed from further analysis.\nFor lignin content, LDA was used (Table\u00a01) as quantitative data was not available. As the purpose of this research was to establish that in principle, lignin could be quantitatively determined using NIR spectroscopy, samples with individual fibre colour change (1) or no observable colour change (0) following the phloroglucinol test were grouped together.\nThese results show that LDA models could be created to successfully distinguish between papers with a high content of lignin (2) and little or no lignin content (0/1). 18 out of the 41 samples with high lignin content came from 2 volumes consisting of 2 series of 7 and 11 books, which could have similar chemical properties although they visually appear different.\nThere are small, but statistically insignificant differences between the models. The spectra of a single layer were taken immediately beside the point where samples were taken for lignin determination, and the spectra taken across 5 layers represent averages across 5 sheets. There is no evidence of material inhomogeneity affecting the results of classification.\nMultivariate regression models were explored for non-destructive determination of date, tensile strength, pH and DP (Table\u00a02).Table\u00a02\nPLS calibration and validation parameters for regression models for date, pH, DP and zero-span tensile strength index (TSI); N\u2014number of samples\nPLS modelCalibrationValidation\nN\nRMSECVFactors\nR\n2\nPre-processing\nN\nRMSEP\nR\n2\nFive sheetsDate1122160.6SNV, MSC33240.53Date post-190086990.67SNV, MSC29150.47pH1350.580.66MSC, S-Golay*, SNV380.70.37DP6337080.84SNV, MSC, S-Golay**216900.52TSI452880.69MSC, SNV, S-Golay*\u2013\u2013\u2013One sheetDate1122170.64MSC, S-Golay*, SNV33310.3Date post-1900861080.74SNV, MSC, S-Golay*29130.41pH1350.570.63MSC, S-Golay*, SNV380.70.4DP6350070.72SNV, MSC, S-Golay*217200.55TSI453080.63MSC, SNV, S-Golay*\u2013\u2013\u2013\nDue to the low number of observations, independent validation was not carried out for TSI\n*First derivative, three-point smoothing, second order polynomial\n**Second derivative, three-point smoothing, second order polynomial\n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a012, PLS calibration and validation scatter plots are shown. Being able to date paper is important for scientific, conservation and curatorial reasons: the change in paper production technology in China that led to industrial standardisation could be more accurately followed, while from a conservation point of view, the age of a paper in conjunction with its pH and DP could reveal its stability. It is possible to hypothesise that dating of paper using NIR is enabled due to the accumulation of degradation products during ageing, as well as due to the frequent changes in the manufacturing processes of historic materials. Both are reflected in the NIR spectra and these in turn enable dating, as has been shown previously for paper as well as for photographs and parchment [47\u201349]. It is not possible, due to the highly overlapped NIR absorption peaks, to examine which compounds or bond types specifically contribute to the success of PLS regressions for dating.\nThe success of dating applications ultimately depends on the accuracy of historic data. These were extracted from the documents themselves where available, but are of doubtful quality where supplier data was used instead, which was mostly the case of pre-1900 samples. For PLS, calibration was generally more satisfactory using 5 layers of paper, which probably reflects the amount of information that is reflected from a thick sample (5 layers) as compared to a thin one (single layer). The models can predict the date of paper with 21\u00a0years uncertainty; however, this is significantly reduced to 13\u00a0years for post-1900 samples. These values are very similar to those reported for European paper [16] which indicates that NIR spectroscopy, in conjunction with PLS, is a method that should be explored further for scientific characterisation of Chinese paper. Spectra of single sheets, while leading to less satisfactory calibrations, can for some properties be considered as acceptable if 5 sheets are not available.\nHowever, the results for pH and DP are less satisfactory, in both cases the high RMSEP values indicate that the value of the current best calibrations to preservation is limited. There could be several reasons for this, to be explored further in future research: despite the number of samples used in this research, there is only a limited pH range covered (4.0\u20138.1) in the first place, with the vast majority in the range 6\u20137.5. Currently, the model is thus able to differentiate between acidic and alkaline samples; however, to increase the accuracy of the calibration, additional acidic paper samples would be needed. Similarly, for DP it also was not possible to obtain a reasonable quality of calibration, which could be due to the high variance of the DP determinations obtained viscometrically as a result of sample inhomogeneity. In this case it may not be possible to improve the calibration by increasing the number of samples, unless a different method for DP determination is used, requiring smaller samples, e.g. size exclusion chromatography.\nA NIR model to evaluate the tensile properties would be valuable for preservation in collections that allow handling of the objects, as the strength of thin Chinese papers is difficult to gauge by handling. However, due to the small number of samples that were available for mechanical testing, we only present the calibration plot in Fig.\u00a012, which shows that with a higher number of samples, an application could be developed in the future.\n\nConclusionsSystematic characterisation of 178 Chinese papers from 19th and 20th century was carried out using various known chemical, mechanical and spectroscopic techniques. The examined sample set was randomly collected and could thus be considered as a representative selection. Compared to Western paper from the same period, significant differences in the examined properties were observed. Although the storage history of the samples is unknown, the following conclusions can be drawn:\nChinese papers are largely neutral with pH mostly between 6 and 8, with only a small proportion of samples with pH\u00a0<\u00a06 (10%).\n\nLignin content varies, with 23% of samples showing a significant reaction using the phloroglucinol test. Only 15 samples showed intensive overall colouration.\n\nThe average DP of the sample set was 1860 for handmade and 1240 for machine-made samples. These values are comparable with European papers of similar age.\n\nLow grammage of traditional Chinese papers is well-known, and machine-made papers were on average 0.08\u00a0mm thick and handmade 0.06\u00a0mm.\n\nA method for determination of zero-span tensile strength was developed and 45 samples could be measured, where enough material was available.\n\nA further characteristic property of traditional Chinese papers is inhomogeneity, which led to up to 20% variance between DP measurements, and up to 0.09\u00a0mm difference in sheet thickness within the same sample. The low grammage also affected NIR spectroscopic analyses: spectra of 1\u201310 layers of paper were compared and from 5 layers on, additional amount of material (i.e. more layers) was considered to no longer significantly affect the spectra.\n\nPLS regression and LDA models were developed for 1 and 5 layers of paper, for pH, DP, zero span tensile strength index, age, and lignin content with varying success. While the model for dating was satisfactory, the pH model\u00a0was least satisfactory due to the small range of pH values of samples in the collection. Models developed using spectra obtained with a single layer were comparable to those obtained with 5 layers, which is ascribed to material inhomogeneity.\n\nFurther research is required to optimise the developed NIR methods for practical application, as increased sample diversity would be desirable, particularly for pH. Due to the observed differences with well-studied European paper, a quantitative understanding of degradation of traditional Chinese paper needs to be developed, which is the focus of our future research.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsNB, DL, TF and MS jointly developed the concept of this work.

The National Archives, UK, where this research was undertaken, holds an estimated six million photographs, of which approximately 90% are silver gelatine.A developed out silver gelatine photograph is composed of an image forming layer, a binder and a support layer. The image can have a variety of image tones from brown, to purplish or grey-black, whilst non-image areas may vary from bright white to cream, ivory and beige [1]. The image may be glossy, satin or matt and the surface texture may be smooth or granular [2]. A typical processed silver gelatine print on fibre-based paper has a light sensitive emulsion composed of silver particles suspended in gelatine, attached to a paper base coated with a baryta layer: barium sulphate in gelatine. Resin coated papers were introduced in the 1960s to reduce washing and drying times and minimise paper cockling [3]. The light sensitive emulsion is attached to a paper base coated with polyethylene (PE). The PE on the image side contains a pigmented layer, usually titanium dioxide.The size and character of silver clumps varies according to the emulsion making technique and the developer used [4]. High relative humidity, residual processing chemicals and pollutants cause changes to the image silver which our naked eye perceives as yellowing, mirroring and fading, all of which indicate image deterioration. This operates through the ionisation of elemental silver which can migrate through gelatine and be reduced to form either colloidal silver (see below), or silver sulfide [5\u20137].Colloidal silver is used in many applications from photovoltaics to biological and chemical sensors. It consists of small spherical silver particles which have unique optical properties. The particles undergo surface plasmon resonance (SPR); in which conductive electrons on the surface collectively oscillate when excited by visible light [8]. The colours scattered by colloidal silver depend on the size, shape, medium and the presence of impurities [9]. In film and photographs they can range from 50 to several hundred \u00c5 in diameter [10]. As particles increase in diameter from 10 to 60\u00a0nm, the peak maximum in their extinction spectra shifts from the blue towards the red, giving media containing such particles a visual appearance that shifts from yellow to red to purple and violet [9]. Silver sulfide formation occurs due to the reaction of silver ions with residual processing chemicals such as sodium thiosulfate. In thin films or colloidal particles, silver sulfide will appear yellow but in experimental work using dilute aqueous sulfide the absorption spectrum of colloidal silver was affected by oxidisation resulting in a brown appearance [9].Image deterioration has largely been assessed using the naked eye, spectrophotometry, TEM and blue filter densitometry, with the instrumental approaches largely applied to film rather than photographic prints to date. Observations by eye require significant experience and can be subjective. Experts claim they can ascribe different causes to different image hues. Weaver [7] and Torigoe [6] used the terms \u2018yellow\u2019 and \u2018yellow-orange\u2019 to describe the effect of oxidising agents on silver gelatine photographs, and \u2018yellow-brown\u2019 and \u2018brownish-red\u2019 to describe sulfide formation; while James [11] used \u2018bronzing\u2019 to describe the effects of relative humidity. Spectrophotometry has been used to confirm the similarity of orange spots on microfilm to laboratory prepared coatings of colloidal silver [12] and to study the transmission densities of silver images on film exposed to oxidising agents at different wavelengths [11]. Work has also been undertaken in the field of optics on the spectral absorption of colloidal silver in gelatine [13, 14]. In these examples the measurements were taken from film, not photographic prints as studied in this work. TEM has been widely used to study the effects of chemicals and environmental conditions on silver filaments [15\u201317] again largely on film.Blue filter densitometry is traditionally used for yellowness evaluation [18] and has been used in both film and prints; Reilly has used it to study albumen prints [19], whilst Nishimura [20] has used it in the development of the photographic activity test (PAT). It cannot provide information on reddening.This study sets out to explore the relationships between colour changes, silver image migration and silver sulfide formation in silver gelatine photographs. This addresses an observed gap in the literature whereby most previous work has focussed on film, rather than photographic prints. It also seeks to understand if observations made by experts can be quantified using spectrophotometry. If this was possible then simple colour measurements could be used to assess photographs without resorting to destructive testing and non-specialists could diagnose deterioration causes and by implication inform conservation decisions in storage, housing, display and conservation treatment.It will address two questions:1.\nIn new and artificially aged silver gelatine photographic prints, is it possible to distinguish between discolouration caused by migration of image silver and that caused by the presence of residual sulfur.\n\u00a02.\nWhat are the complexities of applying these findings to historic photographs?\n\u00a0\nA series of artificially aged and historical samples were evaluated using visual observation, residual silver and hypo spot tests, colour measurements including L*a*b* and reflectance spectra, fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\nMethods\nTest photographs\nThree different photographic papers with optical brightening agents; a fibre-based glossy Fomabrom variant III multi grade paper, a fibre-based matt Fomabrom variant II2 multi grade paper and a resin-coated paper Ilford Multigrade IV resin coated, were processed using the following chemicals:\nDeveloper: Tetenal Eukobrom black and white developer, dilution 1:9.\n\nStop bath: Tetenal Indicet odourless stop bath, dilution 1:19.\n\nFixer: Tetenal Superfix plus rapid fixer, dilution 1:4\n\nWash: washing in running tap water for 15\u00a0min.\n\n\nThe Fomabrom variant III and 112 are manufactured using a silver chloro-bromide emulsion that gives a neutral to medium-warm tone. Multigrade IVRC has a bright base tint with a cool-to-neutral tone. No manufacturer\u2019s information is available for the Multigrade IVRC.\nThe chemicals are supplied in concentrated form and were diluted as per the instructions on the bottles for the different paper types. Six photographs were made on each of the three paper types, totalling 18 test photographs. For each paper type three samples were well processed and three samples were insufficiently-washed. The well processed samples were processed according to the manufacturers instructions and then washed according to the times recommended by BS ISO 18929:2012 [18]. The insufficiently washed samples were not properly washed after processing. They were dipped and then agitated for 5\u00a0s.\nThe image consisted of a 21-step projection scale 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0in. The scale has 21 regularly stepped and numbered density increases from the transparent to the opaque and is used to evaluate the correct exposure and processing times in the lithographic and photographic printing industries. The scale was used to provide density areas large enough to be measured by a spectrophotometer and to facilitate visual observations.\n\nHistorical samples\nFour historical photographs of different ages, paper types and perceived yellowing were selected, see Table\u00a01.Table\u00a01\nNames and dates of the historical samples\nSample nameDateStreet scene (SS)Early 20th century (speculated from the image)Ceremony (C)20th century (speculated from the image)Aeroplane (A)29/10/1945Crumpled manuscript (CM)14/03/1963\n\n\nArtificial ageing\nOne test photo from each paper and processing type was aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH in a Binder climatic chamber KBF for 1\u00a0month. The samples were attached by cotton thread to sheets of polyester (Melinex\u2122) and laid horizontally.\n\nUltraviolet visible induced fluorescence\nAll the photographs were examined with ultraviolet visible induced fluorescence at 366\u00a0nm. This was to detect the presence or absence of optical brightening agents.\n\nSpot tests\n\nIodine potassium iodide\nThe iodine potassium iodide solution was prepared and performed according to Odegaard [21] on a test strip from an un-aged fibre based matt test photograph and a historical matt silver gelatine photograph. This was to determine if the matting agents were starch or colloidal silica.\n\n\nKodak silver test solution ST\u22121 and Kodak hypo test solution HT\u22122\n\nKodak silver test solution ST\u22121 and Kodak hypo test solution HT\u22122 were prepared and executed according to Lav\u00e9drine [22]. Test strips were cut from the un-aged and aged test photographs, and the historical prints. The silver test solution is used to detect prints that have been washed in exhausted fixing baths. The hypo test solution is used to detect prints that have been insufficiently-washed and consequently retain thiosulfate. Both test solutions form irreversible stains and are therefore not well suited to historical collections. The silver test is evaluated as positive if anything more than a simple cream shade results, the hypo test was evaluated using a colour card which was only available online. The ratings for the hypo test are 1\u20134 as follows: barely perceptible 1, slight 2, moderate 3 and heavy 4.\n\n\nVisual observations\nA box was made from grey archival cover paper (320H\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0825W\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0720D\u00a0mm) to view the samples based on a method has been used for the improved damage assessment for parchment [23]. There were five observers. The observers were conservators and conservation technicians specialising in archival materials but not photographs.\nThe samples were compared using a scale that assesses colour change as imperceptible, barely perceptible, slight, moderate or heavy, developed by Honda [24]. The test photographs were rated by comparison between non aged and artificially aged. The historical samples were evaluated for yellowing by comparing the light, mid and dark image tones.\n\nColour measurements\nReflectance spectra, status A(B) densitometry and L*a*b* values were taken using a Konica Minolta spectrophotometer CM-2600d (SCE, 100% UV included, SAV 3\u00a0mm, Primary D65, observer 100) manufactured in Japan. The \u0394L, \u0394a, \u0394b and status A diff. (B) were calculated using SpectraMagic\u2122 NX software using CIEDE2000 for the test photographs. The colour differences were not relevant to the historical samples.\nA template was made with a hole-punch matched to the diameter of the spectrophotometer. Multiple measurement sites were selected for the test photographs: steps 21, 14, 11, 08, 05, 01. Each site was measured three times before and after ageing. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the colour measurements were calculated for steps 5, 8, 11 and 14 to determine if colour changes were actual changes after ageing and not due to a slight misplacement of the template. Three repeat measurements were taken of each, the sample removed and replaced in the template. The RSD of the majority of samples were 0\u20131%, but ranged from 0 to 3%. The error bars in Figs.\u00a05, 8 and 9 show the RSD.\n\nFourier transform infra-red spectroscopy\nIn order to study the effects of artificial ageing on silver gelatine photographs, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ATR FTIR spectroscopy) was used on four test photographs. ATR FTIR spectroscopy was performed with a Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer by Thermo Scientific with a diamond crystal and OMNIC Lite Software. Sixty-four scans at a resolution of 4\u00a0cm\u22121 over the wavenumber range 4000\u2013375\u00a0cm\u22121, were taken from a non image area of nine test photographs which exhibited different degrees of yellowing. The ratio of the amide I and II peaks (found at approx. 1650 and 1550\u00a0cm\u22121 respectively) [25] were compared.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nSections\u00a01\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm were cut and fixed overnight in a solution of 2% glutaraldehyde in distilled water. The sections were washed in distilled water and then gradually dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol\u2013water mixtures to 100% ethanol and infiltrated with Agar 100 resin mix (Agar scientific). The sample was then blocked out and hardened. Ultra-thin sections of 80\u00a0nm thickness were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome with a Diatome diamond knife, collected on Formvar-coated 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm slotted copper grids and viewed in a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. Images were recorded using a Gatan Orius camera.\nImageJ was used to assess the size and quantity of silver particles in the image layer. TEM images at \u00d7\u00a010,000 were used to calculate the approximate number of particles in steps 5 and 11 before ageing. Images at \u00d7\u00a0150,000 were used to calculate the area of the silver filaments and the size and number of colloidal silver particles. An average of nine images were taken from each cross section at \u00d7\u00a0150,000 with the exception of the un-aged well processed and insufficiently washed fibre-based matt samples of which there were three of and two respectively. Colloidal particles were categorised by diameter according to Wiegel (Ware), with a particular focus on a diameter of 0\u201325\u00a0nm.\n\nResults and discussion\nTest photographs before ageing\nThe following results focus on one paper type, fibre based matt. The reader should assume agreement with other paper types unless otherwise mentioned. The data from other paper types is presented in the electronic supplementary information. The details are provided under Availability of data and materials at the end of the article.\n\nVisual observations and spot tests\nTwo hours after processing the insufficiently washed samples on fibre-based papers had started to discolour, see Fig.\u00a01 and emitted a sulphurous smell. A warmer image tone was most noticeable in the lighter step wedges 11\u201321 of the fibre-based papers, whilst the resin-coated papers had barely perceptible yellowing in the non-image areas only. The insufficiently washed samples on all paper types reacted positively to the hypo spot test indicating that the warmer tones in the step wedges were caused by excess sodium thiosulphate (used as fixer) reacting with the image silver to form silver sulfide [1, 26, 27]. The formation of silver sulfide can occur at both room temperature [15] and elevated conditions. The resin coated photograph reacted the least indicating that the polyethylene coating inhibited the retention of sodium thiosulfate.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nFibre based matt test photographs before and after ageing at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH. First row left to right: well processed un-aged, aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH, aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH, second row left to right: corresponding versos of row one, third row: insufficiently washed un-aged, aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH, aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH, fourth row: corresponding versos of row three. Two of the samples are cut to allow direct comparison of the same photograph\n\n\nPhotographs with residual fixer should typically show white highlights but faded and yellowed image tones [26, 27]. This is due to the removal of the unexposed silver from the highlights. Contrary to the literature the background of the insufficiently washed test photographs had slightly yellowed. A TEM image of an un-aged insufficiently washed test photograph was examined and showed a lack of either silver filaments or colloidal silver particles, so silver sulfide formation was discounted.\nThe background yellowing was therefore attributed to a thiosulfate and gelatine interaction as staining of gelatine is well known when in contact with poor quality housing materials [20].\nThe versos of the insufficiently washed fibre based samples had a ghost image illustrating the migration of silver ions [28] and is thought to be brown silver sulfide.\nThe matting agent in these photographs tested negative to the iodine potassium iodide test and is thought to be colloidal silica.\n\n\nSpectrophotometer measurements\nThe L*a*b* values of the well processed and insufficiently washed test photographs were compared before ageing. The insufficiently washed fibre-based glossy (step 21-01) and matt photographs (step 21-08) were less blue and less red, see Fig.\u00a02. This corresponded to visual observations of yellowing in relation to the well processed. The impact of optical brightening agents on colour measurements was seen as negative b* values.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nThe a*b* values of the un-aged well processed (WP) and insufficiently washed (IW) fibre based matt photographs\n\n\n\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nThe silver filaments in the test photographs for all paper types and processing methods were relatively evenly distributed between the baryta layer and the starch coating. The individual filaments making up each filament bundle in the well processed photographs were longer whilst the insufficiently washed samples appeared to be more separated and in some cases shorter or rounder, see Fig.\u00a05. This could be due to the breakdown of the silver particles by the thiosulfate. The insufficiently washed resin-coated paper behaved slightly differently, their filaments appeared a little longer.\nThere was some variation in the size of the silver particles in all samples, but they appeared to correlate with images by Lav\u00e9drine and Reilly [1, 29] on photographic prints showing the filament bundles to be on average 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm across. There were approximately 760,000 silver particles per mm2 in step 5 of the well processed fibre-based glossy paper and 49,500 silver particles per mm2 in the well processed fibre-based glossy paper step 11. This would be expected as step 5 is darker and consequently has more silver. This was in a cross section\u00a080\u00a0nm thick.\n\n\nTest photographs after ageing\n\nVisual observations and spot tests\nTable\u00a02 shows the visual observations and the spot test results made of the well processed and insufficiently washed photographs after degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH. It can be seen that for the well processed photographs, for all paper types no clear change was observed on the recto at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH whilst light discolouration was observed on the versos after degradation. After degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH however, more significant colour changes were observed. The well processed samples aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH looked more yellow green in comparison to the insufficiently washed samples which looked more reddish brown after degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH, and purplish brown after degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH. These findings correspond to previous observations on both film and photographs that discolouration due to the impact of high relative humidity gives a yellowish appearance, while that due to the presence of residual processing chemicals gives a redder appearance.Table\u00a02\nVisual observations and spot test results of the fibre based matt test photographs before and after artificial ageing\nSampleVisual observationsa\nSpot testsBorderImageVersoSilverResidual fixer (thiosulfate)Well processed un-agedImperceptibleImperceptibleImperceptibleNoSlight [2]Well processed aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RHImperceptibleImperceptibleBarely perceptibleNoSlight [2]Well processed aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RHSlightHeavySlightNoSlight [2]Insufficiently washed un-agedBarely perceptibleBarely perceptibleModeratePerceptibleHeavy [4]Insufficiently washed aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RHModerateHeavyHeavyNoHeavy [4]Insufficiently washed aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RHHeavySlightHeavyNoSlight [2]\n\naPerformed according to the scheme by Honda as described in the \u201cMethods\u201d section\n\n\nImage discolouration was less pronounced in the resin coated photographs in the case of both the insufficiently washed and well processed samples. Again it seems logical that the polyethylene layer has reduced moisture uptake by the gelatine, inhibiting sulfur discolouration, silver ionisation and migration. For the same reason it is worth noting that tidelines were observed on the unexposed areas of the insufficiently washed resin coated photograph aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH (adjacent to some of the densest image areas) and a mirrored fingerprint.\nAn increase in the background staining was observed on the recto of the insufficiently washed samples. Brown staining is attributed to excess thiosulfate, especially at elevated temperatures, suggesting the following reaction may be taking place: S2O3\n2\u2212 +\u00a02H+\u00a0\u2192\u00a0SO2 (g)\u00a0+\u00a0S(s)\u00a0+\u00a0H2O and in turn leading to SO2 (g)\u00a0+\u00a0H2O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0H2SO4. Although the contribution of yellowing from gelatine staining to the yellowing measurements of the image areas cannot be accounted for, this excess of thiosulfate, as shown later, was found to inhibit silver migration in the insufficiently washed fibre-based photographs enabling different causes of discolouration i.e. silver sulfide formation and silver migration, to be distinguished from one another.\nThe spot tests indicated a decrease in excess thiosulfate as the RH increased from 70 to 90% RH, suggesting that as the humidity increased the thiosulfate was exhausted through the formation of silver sulfide. The spot tests also demonstrate that little residual thiosulfate was present in the well processed photographs, before or after degradation. Finally they also indicate that silver, silver thiosulfate and thiosulfate were less strongly retained by resin-coated papers compared with fibre-based, reducing the opportunity for colour change due to silver sulfide formation.\n\n\nSpectrophotometer measurements\nResults from the spectrophotometric analysis correspond to the visual observations. The changes in the L*, a*, b* values for the well processed photographs after degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH were small, while after degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH they were more significant for both of the fibre based papers. Differences in the b* values were particularly noticeable, which corresponds to the visually observed yellowing.\nThe insufficiently washed photographs on fibre based paper behaved differently. In comparison to the well processed samples the changes in the b* values were accompanied by significant changes in the L* values, corresponding to a more yellow but darker appearance. They also tended to have a greater \u0394a* in relation to \u0394b* and consequently appear more red. This was true for ageing at both 70 and 90% RH and was most pronounced in the mid tones, particularly around step 8, where we see the least influence from the optical brightening agent. These results are illustrated in Fig.\u00a03 using \u0394L*, \u0394a* and \u0394b*.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nThe \u0394L* \u0394a* \u0394b* values for the well processed (WP) and insufficiently washed (IW) fibre based matt test photographs. Top left: well processed aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH, top right: well processed aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH, bottom left: insufficiently washed aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH, bottom right: insufficiently washed aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH\n\n\nReflectance spectra were also taken. They showed similar effects with greater reflectance in the red at 480\u2013740\u00a0nm in the insufficiently washed samples, see Fig.\u00a04.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nReflectance spectra for an un-aged, aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH and aged 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH well processed (WP) and insufficiently washed (IW) fibre based matt test photograph step 08. The insufficiently washed measurements from the photographs aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH have more reflectance in the red end of the spectrum\n\n\nThese results indicate that a more yellow colour may correspond to the migration of image silver whilst a more reddish colour may correspond to the presence of residual fixer, providing a better understanding of the causes of damage, without resorting to destructive testing.\nThe resin coated photographs behaved differently, with less significant colour change measured or visually perceived in the insufficiently washed photographs aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH or the insufficiently washed and well processed photographs aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH. Contrary to the fibre based samples, the well processed resin coated photographs aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH darkened more than the insufficiently washed resin coated samples aged at both 70% RH and 90% RH. Despite this the insufficiently washed had greater \u0394a* readings than \u0394b*, particularly in steps 14, 11 and 8, corresponding to a redder appearance.\n\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nThe results of TEM show that in the well-processed photographs, exposure to high relative humidity leads to image silver migration and yellowish discolouration, while in the insufficiently washed photographs, with quite extreme levels of residual thiosulfate, silver migration is less prevalent and the reddish discolouration is due to silver sulfide formation. The photographs on resin-coated papers represent an intermediate scenario.\nTransmission electron microscopy images of the fibre based matt well processed test photographs, see Fig.\u00a05 give an indication of the behaviour of the silver image particles under the conditions of artificial degradation. After ageing at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH, there is evidence of silver migration in the well processed photographs on all paper types. In the fibre based papers there were small colloidal silver particles (0\u201310\u00a0nm) quite widely and evenly dispersed around the silver filaments. This was significantly more pronounced in the samples aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH, see Table\u00a03.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nTransmission electron microscopy pictures of the fibre based matt test photographs step 5 at \u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0k (scale bar measures 100\u00a0nm).

Although discolouration was observed in both well processed and insufficiently washed photographs, TEM images showed increased homogeneity of the silver filament in the insufficiently washed photographs and only a limited amount of colloidal silver, see Table\u00a03. This was again particularly pronounced at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH indicating that at these conditions silver sulfide was inhibiting silver migration. The effects of artificial ageing at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH as shown later are probably more similar to naturally aged photographs with residual sulfur.\nIn the resin coated papers the silver filaments were not quite as homogeneous and large amounts of colloidal silver were seen in the upper layers of the cross section at both 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90%. The sulfur appears to have had less impact on the physical shape of the silver filaments so colour differences may therefore be due to very thin layers of silver sulfide or colloidal silver sulfide as described by Ware [9]. The impacts of artificial ageing on the insufficiently washed photographs on resin coated paper may also reflect a more realistic scenario, comparable to that found in a real collection, with a less extreme quantity of residual thiosulfate leading to silver migration alongside silver sulfide formation and subtler colour differences.\nLarger colloidal particles responsible for photographs appearing red (25\u201335\u00a0nm) and purple-red (35\u201345\u00a0nm) [9] were not found to be more evident in the insufficiently washed photographs than the well processed photographs, indicating size of the colloidal silver was not solely responsible for perceived colour differences.\n\n\nATR FTIR spectroscopy\nFourier transform infra-red spectroscopy was used to investigate changes to the gelatine structure. Analysis of four pairs of fibre-based glossy photographs, including both well processed and insufficiently washed samples before and after ageing at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and both 70% and 90% RH was performed. In the insufficiently washed samples, a small increase in the peak ratios between amide I and II was observed after ageing at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH which could suggest some deterioration of the gelatine, most likely due to the additional sulfur. However, more repeated analysis is necessary to assess the significance of these measurements. In summary while a contribution to discolouration from degradation of gelatine cannot be ruled out, the evidence in previous work and in this work certainly provides evidence of the link between silver migration, silver sulfide formation and discolouration.\n\n\nHow do the naturally and artificially degraded samples relate to one another?\n\nNatural and artificial degradation\nThe historical samples, see Fig.\u00a06, were compared to the artificially aged samples to determine the validity of the artificial ageing. The historical photographs are probably all twentieth century images. \u201cAeroplane\u201d and \u201cCrumpled manuscript\u201d have dates written on the verso, see Table\u00a01. The papers are all fibre based and have slightly different paper tones, see Table\u00a04. \u201cStreet scene\u201d has both yellowed highlights and a yellowed paper tone which give the impression of overall yellowing but the shadows are still neutral grey. The iodine potassium iodide test indicated a starch based matting agent. The silver and hypo spot tests showed a lack of silver or residual fixer: this combined with the lack of yellowing in the shadows and the mirroring indicates it is yellowed due to humidity. \u201cCeremony\u201d tested \u2018heavy\u2019 to residual fixer and \u2018perceptible\u2019 to silver indicating the chocolate brown image tones are probably due to the presence of silver sulfide. \u201cAeroplane\u201d had a \u2018slight\u2019 reaction to the residual fixer test and barely perceptible yellowing whilst \u201cCrumpled manuscript\u201d had a \u2018barely perceptible\u2019 reaction to the residual fixer test and imperceptible yellowing. \u201cCrumpled manuscript\u201d has an optical brightening agent and a slightly pinkish hue.\n\nFig.\u00a06\nHistorical samples on fibre-based papers.

There was greater variation in the size and shape of the historical silver filaments than the test photographs and the silver filaments were generally more rounded with fewer long strands. All the samples had some colloidal silver. In trying to make a direct comparison between the silver filaments of the historical and the test photographs, \u201cStreet scene\u201d had small, rounded clumps, widely dispersed and relatively homogeneous with a significant formation of colloidal silver at the surface of the cross section. The presence of relatively large amounts of colloidal silver in the upper layer of the cross section was more similar to the well processed test photos aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH. \u201cCeremony\u2019s\u201d filaments were generally composed of more fragments. This fragmentation of the clumps of silver filaments is seen more often in the insufficiently washed un-aged test photographs but the proximity of colloidal silver around the filaments closest to the baryta layer was more similar to the insufficiently washed test photographs aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH (particularly evident in the fibre based glossy photographs, see https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5213074.v1) whilst the extent of the colloidal silver was more similar to the well processed test photos aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH. Two processes are at work here. As the sulfur content of \u201cCeremony\u201d was probably significantly smaller than the insufficiently washed test samples and the influence of humidity in this process probably great it seems reasonable to expect \u201cCeremony\u2019 would have both fragmented filaments and colloidal silver. The filaments in \u201cAeroplane\u201d had an appearance between those of the well processed and insufficiently washed test samples aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH with some migration of image silver present at the top of the cross section. The filaments in \u201cCrumpled manuscript\u201d were between the well processed un-aged and aged at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH with the least amount of colloidal silver.\n\nFig.\u00a07\nTransmission electron microscope images of the historical samples.

The greater the visually observed yellowing the greater the number of colloidal silver particles for the historical samples. \u201cCeremony\u201d had the greatest number of colloidal silver particles and also the greatest degree of discoloration throughout its image tones despite the presence of residual sulfur. The proximity of more colloidal silver adjacent to the baryta layer suggests the retention of thiosulfate in this area has led to silver ionisation.Table\u00a05\nThe maximum, minimum and average number of colloidal silver particles found in TEM images of historical photographs both surrounding the silver particles and in the upper layer of the cross section\nSampleMaximuma\nMinimuma\nAveragea\nStreet scene3976130b\nCeremony2840801197c\nAeroplane281475d\nCrumpled manuscript201337c\n\n\naRelates to number of colloidal silver particles, defined as having a diameter of 0\u201325\u00a0nm\n\nbAverage of 9 values (six filaments and three from the upper layer of the cross section)\n\ncAverage of 11 values (nine filaments and two from the upper layer of the cross section)\n\ndAverage of 12 values (nine filaments and three from the upper layer of the cross section)\n\n\n\n\nPerceived colour and the presence of residual sulfur\nThe range of paper and image tones of the historical samples make direct comparisons challenging. To help with this colour measurements were taken of their versos (in absence of a white border on the recto) and a light, medium and dark tone on the recto. The L*a*b* and status A (B) densitometry of the historical samples, see Fig.\u00a08, were compared to the residual fixer spot tests. Those samples which tested positive to residual sulfur; \u201cCeremony\u201d, and to a lesser degree \u201cAeroplane\u201d, showed greater positive a* in relation to b* in the mid and dark tones, and in comparison to \u201cStreet scene\u201d which had neutral tones in the dark areas. This was more clearly seen in the reflectance spectra, where both \u201cCeremony\u201d and\u201d Aeroplane\u201d had steeper curves towards the red end of the spectrum than \u201cStreet scene\u201d in the medium and dark areas of the image, see Fig.\u00a08. \u201cCeremony\u201d saw the most dramatic changes in red reflectance from the verso paper colour to the image tone.\n\nFig.\u00a08\nTop: the a*b* and status A (B) results for the historical photographs. Bottom: the reflectance spectra of the dark and medium tones of \u201cStreet scene\u201d and \u201cCeremony\u201d. The spectra show an increased red reflectance in the sulfur affected photograph\n\n\n\u201cCrumpled manuscript\u201d, the sample with optical brightener and a pinkish hue had high a* which decreased towards the dark areas. However, as the spot test shows, \u201cCrumpled manuscript\u201d does not contain residual thiosulfate. In this case a high a* value and a spectrum showing reflectance in the red region would be misleading. The reason for the pinkish hue in this photograph is not known and illustrates that a range of methods are needed in conjunction with spectrophotometry to diagnose sulfur affected photographs, for example: reference photographic sample books, silver and hypo spot test and multiple colour measurements from different parts of the photograph on much larger sample sets of similar ages and paper types.\nSpectrophotometry was useful in detecting the dark and neutral tones of \u201cStreet scene\u201d despite its overall yellowing. This could be useful a diagnostic tool for non experts to study the extent of yellowing in a photographic image.\nThis limited historical sample set indicates it would be worth investigating if a* and an increased red reflectance are greater in sulfur affected images on a larger set of historical photographs.\n\n\nConclusionsThis research shows that in the case of artificially aged test photographs, while image silver migration and silver sulfide formation both give rise to discolouration in silver gelatine photographs, this discolouration is perceived differently, with silver migration causing a yellowish appearance and silver sulfide formation causing a reddish appearance. This can be seen with the naked eye but also quantified using L*a*b*, status A (B) densitometry and reflectance spectra, allowing different degradation mechanisms to be identified. The historical photographs were more complicated.Well processed test photographs degraded at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH appeared visually yellow, had significant increases in the measured b* values and substantial migration of the silver particles visible in TEM images. A large number of colloidal silver particles with diameters of 0\u201325\u00a0nm were formed in these photographs and surface plasmon resonance associated with these particles is believed to be the cause of the observed yellowing.In contrast, the insufficiently washed test photographs with large quantities of residual sulfur appeared either reddish-brown or purplish brown after degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70 and 90% RH respectively and TEM images of the fibre based test photographs showed little or no migration of silver particles and almost no colloidal silver particles with diameters of 0\u201325\u00a0nm. Before artificial ageing the filaments were often more fragmented but with ageing became increasingly homogeneous indicating colour change was probably due to silver sulfide formation around the silver filaments. Colour measurements showed these photographs had both greater a* and smaller L* values than the well processed photographs and consequently appeared both redder but also darker.Artificial ageing of the well processed test photographs at both 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 90% RH and the insufficiently washed photographs at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% RH was found to produce the same or similar migration of image silver when compared to naturally aged historical photographs with one significant exception: the quantity of residual sulfur in the test photographs resulted in smaller quantities of colloidal silver when compared to the sulfur affected historical photographs. The quantity of residual sulfur in the test photographs was extreme and it would be worth more carefully imitating degrees of residual sulfur for future work.In the case of historical photographs, colour differences between well processed and insufficiently washed photographs were harder to distinguish. The historical photographs with residual fixer had slightly greater a* values than the well processed as well as an increased red reflectance. This was more noticeable when colour measurements of the verso were compared. Colour measurements were also found to more clearly identify if a photograph was partially or completely yellowed. This would be useful for both non specialists or conservators without significant experience of photographs when surveying the extent of chemical damage in photographic collections. This investigation indicates colorimetry could be useful in identifying deterioration processes in combination with other techniques such as silver and hypo spot tests and multiple colour measurements from different parts of the photograph on much larger sample sets of similar ages and paper types.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsScientific data gathering, analysis and manuscript draft was carried out by JM.

In addition, three yellow chromates based on barium, zinc and strontium were introduced. While not as popular with artists, these three new yellows were nevertheless adopted throughout the 19th century [2\u20136]. Burnstock et al. identified these compounds in 19th to 20th century pigments and paints using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with elemental analysis [6]. They are still in use today, especially as anticorrosive pigments [7]. Table\u00a01 includes their common and chemical names, chemical formula, colour index (C.I.) numbers and other characteristics.Table\u00a01\nChrome, barium, zinc and strontium yellow pigments: common and chemical names, chemical formula, colour index number (C.I.), refractive index, solubility product constants (K\nsp at 25\u00a0\u00b0C), crystal structure and space group [8\u201311]\nCommon namesChrome yellowBarium yellowLemon yellowa\nZinc yellowCitron yellowStrontium yellowStrontian yellowChemical nameLead chromateBarium chromateZinc potassium chromate hydrateStrontium chromateChemical formulaPbCrO4\nBaCrO4\n4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2OSrCrO4\nC.I. pigment yellow34:7760031:7710336:7795532:77839Refractive index2.3\u20132.651.94\u20131.981.84\u20131.91.92\u20132.01\nK\nsp\n1.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214\n1.17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\n3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211b\n3.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\nCrystal structureMonoclinicOrthorhombicMonoclinicMonoclinicSpace groupP21/nPnmaP21/nP21/n\n\naThe designation \u201clemon yellow\u201d was also used for zinc and strontium chromates [5] but herein it will only refer to barium chromate\n\nbThe solubility product constant of zinc yellow is not tabulated. It was calculated using the data from Simonsen et al. [12]\n\nBarium chromate (BaCrO4), first synthesised and analysed by Vauquelin, resulted from adding a solution of barium nitrate to a chromate or dichromate (e.g. sodium or potassium) solution [1]. Barium chloride may also be used as an alternative source of barium [2, 13]. Throughout the 19th century, barium chromate was known under several different names including: barium yellow, lemon yellow, ultramarine yellow, baryta yellow and Steinb\u00fchl yellow [2, 14].Zinc chromate with the approximate composition of 4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O also appeared in the beginning of the 19th century, and the origin of its discovery is unclear [1]. Recently, Simonsen et al. have determined its structure as KZn2(CrO4)2H2O(OH) by single-crystal X-ray crystallography [12]. This pigment is formed by precipitation when a solution of a zinc salt is added to a chromate solution (e.g. of sodium or potassium), in the presence of potassium ions [2]. During the 19th century, the most common names for zinc chromate were zinc yellow and citron yellow but it was also labeled as ultramarine yellow, yellow button of gold and permanent yellow [2, 5, 14].It is also uncertain who synthesised strontium chromate (SrCrO4) for the first time [2, 14]. Presently it is obtained when a solution of strontium chloride is added to a sodium dichromate solution [7]. During the 19th century onwards, it appears variously as: strontian yellow, strontaine yellow, lemon yellow and ultramarine yellow (the last two names could also refer to barium chromate) [2, 5, 14].Of the three yellow chromate pigments, barium chromate is considered the most lightfast, nevertheless, it is reported to turn green after long exposure to light [1]. This agrees with the reactivity model suggested by Monico and Tan et al., that relates the tendency to degrade with the solubility of the chromate pigments, see Table\u00a01 [15, 16]. Darkening of zinc chromate (4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O) has been observed in Georges Seurat\u2019s paintings including A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884 [4, 17\u201319]. Casadio et al. studied the darkening of oil paints prepared with a modern zinc yellow (DuPont, Y-539-D; PS-83109) and cold pressed linseed oil (W&N), and subjected to artificial aging under combined environmental conditions: light/dark, air humidity (50 and 90% RH) and acidic gases (SO2 and CO2). Colour changes were observed in all aging experiments, but the highest degree of darkening occurred in the presence of light, SO2 and 90% RH. By means of Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), they determined that the darkening is related to the reduction of the original Cr(VI) in zinc yellow pigment to Cr(III) species such as the green chromium oxide (Cr2O3). Orange Cr(VI) dichromate species were also detected in the samples aged under light, SO2 and 50% RH [17\u201319].\nThe investigative methodology\nThe present study was prompted by the identification of barium and zinc chromate in oil paintings by the Portuguese Naturalists Ant\u00f3nio Silva Porto (1850\u20131893) and Jo\u00e3o Marques de Oliveira (1853\u20131927), Fig.\u00a01 (see also Additional file 1: Figure S1) [20]. Strontium chromate was also found in oil paintings by Silva Porto [20] and by the Portuguese Modernist Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso (1887\u20131918), Fig.\u00a02 [21]. The study of the materials and techniques of these painters was carried out in the framework of the interdisciplinary project \u2018Crossing Borders: History, materials and techniques of Portuguese painters from 1850 to 1918 (Romanticism, Naturalism and Modernism)\u2019. Previously, Correia et al. had identified barium and strontium chromate using \u03bc-Raman in oil paintings by the Portuguese Naturalist Henrique Pous\u00e3o (1859\u20131884) [22].\n\nFig.\u00a01\nTop: \u00c0 espera dos barcos (estudo) [\u2018Waiting for the boats (study)\u2019] (1891, 25.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a037.5\u00a0cm) by Marques de Oliveira, National Museum of Contemporary Art\u2014Museu do Chiado (Museu Nacional de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea do Chiado), Lisbon.

Following the methodology established for the study of W&N\u2019s lead chromate yellow pigments [25], this paper investigates the preparation and chemistry of barium, zinc and strontium chromate pigments. During the 19th century, these pigments were sold by W&N under the trade names Lemon Yellow (barium chromate), Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate). According to Carlyle, who studied the powders and oil colours available in the W&N 19th century catalogues, the first was listed in c.1835 while the latter two appeared for the first time in a catalogue from c.1861. Strontian Yellow last appeared in a catalogue from c.1896 [5].\nThe methodology of this study involved analysing W&N\u2019s pigment production records to establish the main method of synthesis for each pigment, then reconstructing the pigment to serve as a reference sample. The chemistry and characteristics of the reconstructed pigments were investigated using Fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman (\u03bc-Raman) and micro-Fourier transform infrared (\u03bc-FTIR) spectroscopies. Their composition was compared with samples from a late 19th century W&N \u201cLemon Yellow\u201d tube of oil paint and late 19th-and early 20th century Portuguese oil paintings, Figs.\u00a01 and 2.\n\nResults and discussion\nResearch using the W&N 19th century archive database\nResearch into W&N\u2019s pigment manufacture using the W&N 19th century archive database resulted in the identification of 103 production records for yellow chromate pigments based on barium, zinc and strontium (compared with 183 productions records found for yellow lead chromate pigments [25]). There are 71 production records for Lemon Yellow (also under the names Chromate Barytes and Permanent Primrose) corresponding to barium chromate, 26 for Citron Yellow (or Chromate of Zinc) which correspond to zinc potassium chromate, and six for Strontian Yellow (or Chromate Strontia) resulting in strontium chromate. Contrary to the wide range of names used for lead chromate pigments in W&N\u2019s production records [25], further variations on naming for these three pigments were not found in the W&N archive.\nThe pigment composition in the production records is in agreement with W&N\u2019s declaration of their pigment compositions from 18921 where Lemon Yellow is described as chromate of barium and Citron Yellow is given as chromate of zinc. On the other hand, it is notable that Strontian Yellow is not included in W&N\u2019s 1892 declaration. Its absence is likely because it was considered too fugitive for W&N and may explain why there are so few records for the production of strontium chromate. Evidence for this assumption appears in a book belonging to Arthur Henry Newton (son of W&N\u2019s founder Henry Charles Newton). Associated with a recipe for a physical mixture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate) with Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate) which appears under the name: \u201cStrontian Yellow: No. 2 for Oil\u201d, dated 23/11/1859, is a note: \u201cIn Father\u2019s opinion this is a much safer color to use in oil than Chromate of Strontia\u201d (W&N Database Unique Recipe Code: P2P264AL07). In W&N\u2019s 1892 declaration, this physical mixture appears under the name Primrose Yellow and is described as \u201csimilar in colour to the old \u2018Strontian Yellow\u2019 (Chromate of Strontium) but keeps its colour better\u201d. Despite this observation both Citron Yellow and Primrose Yellow were nevertheless designated fugitive in oil in W&N\u2019s 1892 declaration, with only Lemon Yellow considered permanent in oil. Interestingly, this is contrary to the position of Jehan-Georges Vibert, a 19th century authority on painting materials and supplier as well as consultant to the 19th century artists\u2019 colourman Lefranc & Co. [3, 5]. He placed strontium chromate in a list of permanent or \u201cgood\u201d pigments, together with zinc chromate whereas barium chromate belonged to the list of \u201cbad\u201d pigments (he declared lead chromate pigments \u201cmore or less bad\u201d) [26].\n\nW&N manufacturing processes for barium, zinc and strontium chromate pigments\nAs found to be the case for W&N\u2019s 19th century manufacture of lead chromate pigments [25], once all the production records were analysed for barium, zinc and strontium chromates, it was evident that the company was using a limited number of methods for synthesis. Their main synthetic pathways are described in Table\u00a02. The full range of process variations is presented in the Additional file 2 along with the number of production records and the date range for each manufacturing process (Additional file 2: Tables S1\u2013S4, Figures S2\u2013S4).Table\u00a02\nW&N\u2019s lemon, citron and strontian yellows: key ingredients, main synthetic pathways and final pigment formulation, compared with one of the main pathways to produce W&N Chrome Yellow (Lemon Chrome) [25]\n\n\n\n\nThe core difference between W&N\u2019s 19th century manufacture of barium, zinc and strontium chromate and lead chromate pigments is the degree of experimentation (Table\u00a02). For the lead chromates, W&N extensively tested sources for chromate, sulphate and lead as well as additives such as extenders and fillers [25]. In the manufacture of barium, zinc and strontium chromate pigments, experimentation was reduced to the choice of the chromate and metal ion source. No extenders or fillers were tested likely because these pigments present a lower tinting strength [27], see Tables\u00a02, 3. Interestingly, Burnstock et al. did not find extenders in samples where these pigments were detected [6].Table\u00a03\nReconstructions of W&N\u2019s Lemon (LY1a), Citron (CY1a) and Strontian (SY1a) yellow pigments following their main synthetic pathways: final pH, L*a*b* colour coordinates, relative tinting strength (% TS) and inflection point (\u03bbIP, nm) of the reflectance spectra\n\u00a0Final pHa\nL*a*b*% TSb\n\u03bbIP (nm)\n\n\u2248\u00a0189.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u2212\u00a07.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.552.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.892450\n\n\u2248\u00a0586.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.488.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.865510\n\n\u2248\u00a0894.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u2212\u00a011.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.255.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.278483 (445, sh)\n\naFinal pH was measured at the end of the precipitation\n\nbThe relative tinting strength was calculated using the ASTM standard test method D4838\u201388(2003) and pure lead chromate was used as the standard (100% TS). For more details see the \u201cExperimental\u201d section\n\n\nTable\u00a02 shows that to produce W&N\u2019s Lemon, Citron and Strontian Yellow, solutions of barium chloride, zinc nitrate and strontium nitrate were respectively added to a chromate solution (CrO4\n2\u2212). In the case of Citron Yellow, potassium carbonate was added as a buffer but may also act as an extra source of potassium. The resulting pigments present lighter yellow hues compared with pure lead chromate pigments [25], as presented in Table\u00a03.\n\nLemon Yellow (barium chromate, BaCrO4)\nThe 71 production records found for Lemon Yellow cover the period from 1838 to 1880. These can be reduced to three main methods of synthesis. All manufacturing processes are depicted in Additional file 2: Table S2 .\nThe majority of the Lemon Yellow production records (64) pertain to the process coded LY1a, Table\u00a02 and Eq.\u00a01.$$ {\\text{Cr}}_{2} {\\text{O}}_{7}^{2 - } ({\\text{aq}}) + 2{\\text{Ba}}^{2 + } ({\\text{aq}}) + {\\text{H}}_{2} {\\text{O}} \\to 2{\\mathbf{BaCrO}}_{{\\mathbf{4}}} \\left( {\\mathbf{s}} \\right) + 2{\\text{H}}^{ + } ({\\text{aq}}) $$ (1)\nThis is the only chromate pigment method of synthesis where W&N chose to use potassium dichromate alone without the addition of a buffer (in the form of a carbonate). This results in a very acidic final pH, Table\u00a03. Of the three chromates studied here, barium chromate is the only one that precipitates regardless of the pH, hence the absence of the buffer.\nFour production records were found where a buffered chromate solution (potassium dichromate with potassium carbonate) was used. A single experiment with potassium chromate alone (this would result in a basic final pH) was also conducted. Barium nitrate was also tried in two production records to substitute for barium chloride.\n\nCitron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate, 4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O)\nTwenty-six production records were found for zinc potassium chromate under the name Citron Yellow and Chromate of Zinc. These cover the period from 1834 to 1893 with the majority of the records dated in the 1850s. There are only three main methods of synthesis. All variations are presented in Additional file 2: Table S3.\nMost of the Citron Yellow productions records (18) correspond to the process coded CY1a, Table\u00a02 and Eq.\u00a02.$$ 4{\\text{CrO}}{}_{4}^{2 - } ({\\text{aq}}) + 2{\\text{K}}^{ + } ({\\text{aq}}) + 4{\\text{Zn}}^{2 + } ({\\text{aq}}) + 4{\\text{H}}_{2} {\\text{O}} \\to 4{\\mathbf{ZnCrO}}_{{\\mathbf{4}}} \\cdot {\\mathbf{K}}_{{\\mathbf{2}}} {\\mathbf{O}} \\cdot {\\mathbf{3H}}_{{\\mathbf{2}}} {\\mathbf{O}}\\left( {\\mathbf{s}} \\right) + 2{\\text{H}}^{ + } ({\\text{aq}}) $$ (2)\n\nFor the manufacture of their Citron Yellow, W&N primarily used potassium dichromate as the chromate source. Potassium carbonate was added to play three functions: to shift the dissociation reaction of dichromate into chromate, and to act as a buffer and an additional potassium source. This particular reaction results in a pigment formula different from the common chemical formula of yellow chromates, MCrO4 (M=Pb, Ba and Sr), since potassium ion (K) and \u201chydroxo aqua\u201d ions are present in the crystal structure together with the zinc ion (Zn), Eq.\u00a02 [12]. For this particular formula to precipitate, the buffered chromate solution needs to be around pH 6 (achieved by the addition of the potassium carbonate) when the zinc nitrate is added. Precipitation does not occur in acidic conditions. There are five production records where potassium dichromate was used with sodium carbonate. W&N also experimented with zinc sulphate and zinc acetate as zinc sources. In addition, they performed a test with potassium dichromate and zinc sulphate but it is unlikely that this resulted in pigment precipitation, due to the low pH of the potassium dichromate solution.\n\nStrontian Yellow (strontium chromate, SrCrO4)\nFew production records were found for Strontian Yellow: just six, all dated in the 1850s. There were three methods of synthesis, which are depicted in Additional file 2: Table S4. As noted above, the low number of production records suggests that W&N was not producing and consequently not selling strontium chromate on a large scale.\nThe majority of the Strontian Yellow productions records (4) pertain to the process coded SY1a, Table\u00a02 and Eq.\u00a03.$$ {\\text{CrO}}{}_{4}^{2 - } ({\\text{aq}}) + {\\text{Sr}}^{2 + } ({\\text{aq}}) \\to {\\mathbf{SrCrO}}{}_{{\\mathbf{4}}}\\left( {\\mathbf{s}} \\right) $$ (3)\n\nIn addition to the main synthetic pathway, there is one production record where the pathway is very similar to CY1a, with the addition of potassium carbonate before and during pigment precipitation, and another record where potassium chromate is used alone. As observed for zinc potassium chromate, when potassium dichromate is used, a carbonate compound must be added to shift the dissociation reaction of dichromate into chromate, enabling the precipitation to occur at pH\u00a0>\u00a06. No other sources of strontium were tested.\n\nAnalytical characterisation of the reconstructed pigments\nThe pigment reconstructions were synthesised following selected production records representative of W&N\u2019s main manufacturing processes (Table\u00a02). Syntheses are detailed in the experimental section. As mentioned above, the reconstructed pigments were then characterised by colorimetry, FORS, XRD, \u03bc-Raman and \u03bc-FTIR spectroscopies (experimental conditions in the \u201cExperimental\u201d section).\nL*a*b* colour coordinates and the inflection point (\u03bbIP, nm) of the reflectance spectra are shown in Table\u00a03. Lemon and Strontian Yellows (b* around fifty) present a more greenish tone (a* negative) than Citron Yellow (a* positive). As shown in Fig.\u00a03, their reflectance spectra present distinctive inflection points enabling their in situ identification by FORS. However, Citron Yellow presents the inflection point of the reflectance spectra closer to that observed for the lighter hues of lead chromate pigments [25].\n\nFig.\u00a03\nNormalized FORS spectra of the pigment reconstructions for W&N\u2019s Lemon (BaCrO4), strontian (SrCrO4) and Citron (4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O) Yellows\n\n\nThe identification of these yellow chromate pigments is very straightforward by \u03bc-FTIR, \u03bc-Raman and XRD. Their distinctive infrared and Raman spectral fingerprints are shown in Fig.\u00a04, and their diffraction patterns (identification cards from the International Centre for Diffraction Data, ICDD) are presented in Figs.\u00a05 and 6.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nInfrared (left) and Raman (right) spectra of the pigment reconstructions for W&N\u2019s Lemon (BaCrO4), Citron (4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O) and Strontian (SrCrO4) Yellows\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a05\nDiffraction patterns of the pigment reconstructions for W&N\u2019s Citron (matched with 4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O ICDD card 00-008-0202) and Strontian (matched with SrCrO4 ICDD card 00-035-0743) Yellows\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a06\n\na Infrared spectra (inset between 1000 and 750\u00a0cm\u22121) and b diffraction patterns (matched with BaCrO4 ICDD card 00-078-1401) of a late 19th century W&N \u201cLemon Yellow\u201d oil paint tube compared with a LY1a pigment reconstruction; (\n\n\n                            \n                          ) BaCrO4, (\u25cf) MgCO3\u00b7H2O\n\n\nThe characteristic infrared and Raman bands of the pigments\u2019 chromophores are detailed in Table\u00a04 and the spectral assignments were made in accordance to the literature [12, 13, 22, 28\u201330]. As may be seen in Fig.\u00a04 and Table\u00a04, their infrared spectra present distinctive spectral profiles assigned to the CrO4\n2\u2212 asymmetric stretching mode (between 1000 and 700\u00a0cm\u22121). On the other hand, their Raman spectra display differences in their main band assigned to the CrO4\n2\u2212 symmetric stretching mode, which together with the CrO4\n2\u2212 asymmetric stretching bands (in the region 850\u2013950\u00a0cm\u22121) allows a complete differentiation between these pigments. This is particularly important when these pigments are found together as will be shown below.Table\u00a04\nReconstructions of W&N\u2019s Lemon (LY1a), Citron (CY1a) and Strontian (SY1a) yellow pigments: pigment composition, Raman and infrared characteristic bands [12, 13, 22, 28\u201330] (the main bands appear in italic)\nPigment compositionLemon yellow (LY1a)Citron yellow (CY1a)Strontian yellow (SY1a)BaCrO4 orthorhombic\u00a04ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O monoclinic\u00a0SrCrO4 monoclinic\u00a0Infrared bands (cm\u22121)\u00a0\u03bd(OH)\u2013\u00a03442\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u03bdas(CrO4\n2\u2212)\n885\ns\n881\ns\n911\ns855sh951, 809sh888, 874, 843shRaman bands (cm\u22121)\u00a0\u03b4(CrO4\n2\u2212)349, 360, 403, 427w\u2013m342, 408w\u2013m338, 348, 374, 400w\u2013m\u00a0\u03bds(CrO4\n2\u2212)\n862\ns\n872\ns\n866\ns\u00a0\u03bdas(CrO4\n2\u2212)872, 898, 906w\u2013m892sh894m\u00a0\u00a0940m916, 930w\u2013m\n\nw\u2013m weak to medium, m medium, s strong, sh shoulder\n\n\n\nComparison of the pigment reconstructions with paint samples from an historic W&N oil paint tube and from late 19th\u2013early 20th century oil paintings\nA comparison was made with a late 19th century W&N oil paint tube labelled \u201cLemon Yellow\u201d (dated according to the data on the label; more details in the \u201cExperimental\u201d section). The pigment in the tube is composed of barium chromate and the additive magnesium carbonate was also found, Fig.\u00a06. Magnesium carbonate was only detected by \u03bc-FTIR, not by XRD, which means it is most probably in its amorphous form. As seen in Fig.\u00a06, the infrared (between 1000 and 750\u00a0cm\u22121) and diffraction pattern of the pigment in the \u201cLemon Yellow\u201d oil paint tube presents a very good match with the pigment reconstruction for W&N\u2019s Lemon Yellow (LY1a, barium chromate). The presence of magnesium carbonate in the oil paint tube is very interesting. This material was not listed in any of the W&N production records for manufacturing Lemon Yellow pigments, nor was it found in any of their 19th century production records for lead chromate pigments but it was detected in 19th century W&N lead chromate oil paint tubes [25]. However magnesium carbonate does appear in some of W&N\u2019s oil paint formulations under the term \u201cspar\u201d [25], as revealed by a search in the on-line W&N Archive Database under the book code GR (entitled \u2018Oil Grinding at New Factory, various colours at different dates\u2019) [31]. It is possible that magnesium carbonate may be a good marker for W&N\u2019s oil paints. Investigation into the oil paint formulations of other contemporary colourmen will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.\nBarium, zinc potassium and strontium chromates have been found in oil paintings by the Portuguese Naturalists Marques de Oliveira and Silva Porto, Fig.\u00a01 and Additional file 1: Figure S1 [20]. Their identification has been primarily carried out by analysis of cross-sections from yellow colours using \u03bc-Raman, Additional file 3: Figures S5\u2013S7.\nNonetheless, in the infrared spectrum of a \u03bc-sample from the yellow paint in the woman\u2019s scarf in Marques de Oliveira\u2019s painting \u00c0 espera dos barcos (estudo) (Fig.\u00a01 Top) it was possible to find the CrO4\n2\u2212 asymmetric stretching fingerprint profile (between 1000 and 700\u00a0cm\u22121) of a pigment reconstruction for W&N\u2019s Citron Yellow (CY1a, zinc potassium chromate), Fig.\u00a07a. This pigment was found together with barium chromate and lead white, whose presence was confirmed by \u03bc-Raman, Fig.\u00a07b and Additional file 3: Figure S5. In the same painting, the pigment zinc potassium chromate was found mixed with Prussian blue and lead white to produce the green colour in the sea.\n\nFig.\u00a07\n\na Infrared (inset between 1000 and 700\u00a0cm\u22121) and b Raman spectra of a yellow \u03bc-sample from Marques de Oliveira\u2019s painting \u00c0 espera dos barcos (estudo), 1891 (Fig.\u00a01 top), compared with the spectra of a CY1a pigment reconstruction; (\u271a) 4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O, (\n\n\n                            \n                          ) BaCrO4; (\u2727) zinc carboxylate, (\u25a0) 2PbCO3\u00b7Pb(OH)2\n\n\n\nStrontium chromate was also identified in the painting Entrada (Fig.\u00a02) by the Portuguese Modernist Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso [21]. The infrared and \u03bc-Raman spectra of the yellow paint are presented in Fig.\u00a08 showing a direct match with the CrO4\n2\u2212 stretching fingerprint spectral profile of a pigment reconstruction for W&N\u2019s Strontian Yellow (SY1a, strontium chromate). Despite this match, we believe that this strontium chromate was supplied by a manufacturer other than W&N since we feel it was unlikely that W&N was selling strontium chromate at the time this painting was executed in the beginning of the 20th century. Furthermore, strontium chromate was found together with lead white, strontium sulphate and gypsum, Fig.\u00a08a. The presence of these extenders also supports our assumption that this paint was most probably supplied by another manufacturer but we cannot exclude the possibility that this particular mixture could have been prepared by Amadeo himself.\n\nFig.\u00a08\n\na Infrared (inset between 1000 and 800\u00a0cm\u22121) and b Raman spectra of a yellow \u03bc-sample from Amadeo\u2019s painting Entrada, c.1917 (Fig.\u00a02), compared with the spectra of a SY1a pigment reconstruction; (\u2739) SrCrO4, (\u25a0) 2PbCO3\u00b7Pb(OH)2, (\n\n\n                            \n                          ) SrSO4, (\u25c6) CaSO4\u00b72H2O, (\u2727) zinc carboxylate\n\n\n\nConclusionsAccess to the production records from W&N\u2019s 19th century archive database made it possible to carry out a comprehensive study of their manufacturing processes for yellow chromate pigments based on barium (BaCrO4), zinc (4ZnCrO4\u00b7K2O\u00b73H2O) and strontium (SrCrO4). One hundred and three production records were found for the manufacture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate, 69%), Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate, 25%) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate, 6%). The majority covers the period between 1838 and 1871. Analysis of W&N\u2019s production records indicates that one main synthetic pathway was found for each pigment. The pH was a key factor controlled by W&N to achieve precipitation of zinc potassium and strontium chromate pigments. There was no evidence that extenders were added during the synthesis of these pigments, whereas their production records for lead chromates do show the addition of extenders [25]. The lack of extenders for these pigments may infer that for W&N, extenders were primarily present to adjust physical properties, tinting strength or hue, rather than functioning predominantly as a means to reduce the cost of materials. The relative tinting strength (TS) of these pigments is lower than pure lead chromate pigments. It was calculated in comparison to pure lead chromate (PbCrO4,) which was assigned a TS of 100%. This resulted in a TS of 92% for barium, 78% for strontium and 65% for zinc potassium chromate pigments.The low number of production records for strontium chromate indicates that W&N was not selling a Strontian Yellow composed of strontium chromate on a large scale. As discussed above, evidence from their archive and their 1892 publication of colour compositions indicates that they rejected this pigment due to it being considered fugitive. This provides further evidence to support our conclusion that W&N had a strong commitment to the durability of their products [25, 27].The unique spectral fingerprints of the reconstructed pigments produced in accordance to W&N\u2019s main manufacturing processes correlate very well with those detected in samples from a late 19th century W&N \u201cLemon Yellow\u201d oil paint tube and from late 19th and early 20th century Portuguese oil paintings. This validates their function as reference materials and contributes to a better understanding of the appearance and condition of these pigments when freshly produced. These reconstructed pigments are now available for further chemical studies to characterise and verify mechanisms of degradation and change.\nExperimental\nReagents\nAll reagents and solvents were of analytical grade, and Millipore water was used.\n\nPigment synthesis methods\nThe pigment synthesis methods followed the main synthetic pathways depicted in Table\u00a02. All pigments were thoroughly washed with cold water and diethyl ether, dried and then ground to a powder.\nBarium chromate was prepared by adding 10\u00a0ml of an aqueous solution of barium chloride [5\u00a0g (0.02\u00a0mol) of BaCl2 dissolved in 30\u00a0ml of H2O] to 100\u00a0ml of boiling water where an aqueous solution of potassium dichromate [1.3\u00a0g (0.004\u00a0mol) of K2Cr2O7 dissolved in 13\u00a0ml of H2O] was previously added. The solution where precipitation occurred was kept stirring for 10\u00a0min and left to settle for 1\u00a0h. Yield \u2248\u00a075%.\nZinc potassium chromate hydrate was synthesized by adding, dropwise, 50\u00a0ml of an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate [2.9\u00a0g (0.01\u00a0mol) of Zn(NO2)3\u00b76H2O dissolved in 50\u00a0ml of H2O] to an aqueous solution of potassium dichromate and potassium carbonate [2.9\u00a0g (0.01\u00a0mol) of K2Cr2O7 and 0.3\u00a0g (0.002\u00a0mol) of K2CO3]. After the addition of zinc nitrate, 0.05\u00a0g (0.0004\u00a0mol) of K2CO3 was added. The solution where precipitation occurred was kept stirring for 15\u00a0min. Yield \u2248\u00a059%.\nStrontium chromate was produced by adding an aqueous solution of strontium nitrate [1.1\u00a0g (0.005\u00a0mol) of Sr(NO3)2 dissolved in 25\u00a0ml of boiling H2O] to an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 0.75\u00a0g (0.0025\u00a0mol) of K2Cr2O7 in 25\u00a0ml of boiling H2O and then adding Na2CO3 until a neutral pH was reached. The solution where precipitation occurred was kept stirring for 10\u00a0min and left to settle until next day. Yield \u2248\u00a069%.\n\nCalculation of the tinting strength\nThe relative tinting strength was calculated using the ASTM Standard Test Method D4838\u201388(2003). Poly(vinyl acetate) paints were prepared with the reconstructed pigments and barium sulphate, which was added until a maximum reflectance between 35 and 45% was obtained. A poly(vinyl acetate) paint of lead chromate and barium sulphate was used as the standard. The reflectance spectra were acquired in paint drawdowns applied with a thickness of 100\u00a0\u03bcm. The relative tinting strength calculated does not account for differences in hue and chroma.\n\nSamples\nMicro-sampling of the oil paintings was carried out using a micro-chisel from Ted Pella microtools under a Leica MZ16 stereomicroscope (7.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0to 115\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0zoom range), equipped with a Leica ICD digital camera and a fibre-optic light Leica system (Leica KI 1500 LCD).\nThe late 19th century W&N Lemon Yellow oil paint tube was acquired on eBay and dated according to the appearance and data on the label. It contained enough paint for characterisation by XRD.\n\nApparatus\n\nColorimetry\nFor measuring colour, a portable spectrophotometer colorimetry Data Color International was used. Its measuring head\u2019s optical system uses diffuse illumination from a pulsed Xenon arc lamp over the 8\u00a0mm-diameter measuring area, with 0\u00ba viewing angle geometry. Colour coordinates were calculated defining the D65 illuminant and the 10\u00ba observer. The reference source chosen was C and calibration was performed with a white, bright standard plate (L*\u00a0=\u00a097.83; a*\u00a0=\u00a00.52; b*\u00a0=\u00a02.39) and a total black standard. Colour, as perceived by the human eye, may be represented in a three dimensional system. The colour data are presented in the CIE-Lab system. In the Lab cartesian system, L*, relative brightness, is represented by the z-axis. Variations in relative brightness range from white (L*\u00a0=\u00a0100) to black (L*\u00a0=\u00a00). The red\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0green y-axis plots a*, ranging from negative values (green) to positive (red). The yellow\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0blue x-axis reports b*, going from negative (blue) to positive numbers (yellow). The (a*, b*) pair represents the hue of the object.\n\n\nFORS\nReflectance spectra were acquired with Ocean Optics equipment composed by a single-beam dispersive fibre optic spectrometer (model MAYA 2000 PRO) equipped with 2048 linear silicon CCD array detector (Hamamatsu). The MAYA 2000 PRO has a spectral response from 200 to 1050\u00a0nm. The illumination is an Ocean Optics HL-2000-HP with 20\u00a0W halogen light source in a single optical path covering the 360\u20132400\u00a0nm range. Spectra were obtained with an integration time of 8\u00a0ms and 15 scans to average. The measuring head, in a 45\u00b0/45\u00b0 (illumination/acquisition angles) configuration, gives a diameter of analysis of about 2\u00a0mm. As reference a Spectralon\u00ae\u00a0standard was used. The wavelength of the inflection point was obtained from the reflectance spectra.\n\n\nXRD\nX-ray diffractograms were acquired with a PANalytical X\u2019Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a X\u2019Celerator detector and using CuK\u03b1 radiation in the 10\u00a0<\u00a02\u03b8\u00a0<\u00a080 range with a step size of 0.02\u00ba in Bragg\u2013Brentano configuration. XRD was performed at CENIMAT/i3N\u2014Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Materiais/Instituto de Nanoestruturas, Nanomodela\u00e7\u00e3o e Nanofabrica\u00e7\u00e3o of the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa.\n\n\nMicro-Raman\nRaman microscopy was carried out using a Labram 300 Jobin\u2013Yvon spectrometer, equipped with a HeNe laser 17\u00a0mW operating at 632.8\u00a0nm. Spectra were recorded as an extended scan. The laser beam was focused with 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Olympus objective lens. The laser power at the surface of the samples was varied with the aid of a set of neutral density filters. All samples were analysed using 15\u00a0s laser exposure time for five scans.\n\n\nMicro-FTIR\nInfrared analyses were carried out with a Nicolet Nexus spectrophotometer coupled to a Continu\u03bcm microscope (15\u00a0\u00d7 Objective) with a MCT-A detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The pigments were prepared as KBr pellets, and spectra were collected in transmission mode, with a resolution of 4\u00a0cm\u22121 and 64 scans. For the micro-samples from oil paints and paintings, spectra were obtained in transmission mode, 4000\u2013650\u00a0cm\u22121, with a resolution of 4\u00a0cm\u22121 and 128 scans, using a Thermo diamond anvil compression cell. The spectra are shown here as acquired, without corrections or any further manipulations, except for the removal of the CO2 absorption at ca. 2300\u20132400\u00a0cm\u22121.\n\n\nFootnotes1In 1892, W&N was the first artists' colourmen to publish a document on the chemical composition and permanence of their colours (analysed and studied by them), which was included in their catalogues from this time forward.\u00a0\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsVO carried out the investigation on the yellow chromate pigments and drafted the manuscript.

A large variety of analytical techniques including optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM\u2013EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOFSIMS), synchrotron radiation FTIR (SR-FTIR) and synchrotron radiation XRD (SR-XRD), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy have been used to investigate structures and compositions of the corrosion products in recent years [4\u20139]. It is well known that the character of the corrosion products of bronze artifacts buried in soil depends on multiple factors such as the nature of the alloy, soil composition, porosity, humidity, conductivity, depth and duration of burial [10, 11].The Lijiaba site (31\u00b06\u203215\u2033 N, 108\u00b041\u2032 E, Fig.\u00a01), located in Qingshu village of Yunyang county in Chongqing (southwest China) and by the Pengxi River (a branch of the Yangtze River), is a well-preserved cultural site. Material remains revealed by archaeological surveys and excavations in 1998 and 1999 suggest this site was occupied from the Shang-Zhou Dynasty to the Six Dynasties (1700 BC\u2013600 AD) [12, 13]. Due to the outstanding nature of the finds, it was selected as one of the top ten archaeological discoveries in China in 1998. A large number of tombs belonging to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770\u2013221 BC), which comprises the Spring and Autumn period (770\u2013475 BC) and the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BC) were excavated. Many bronze weapons were unearthed including swords, spears, pole spears, dagger-axes and fu-axes, a type of assemblage which differs from burial sites of the period in other areas of China where large numbers of sacrificial vessels have been recovered. The bronze weapons at Lijiaba site show decorative motifs which include tigers, aquatic birds, cicadas, arms, hearts, cloudscapes and other patterns on swords, spears, dagger-axes, whereas geometrical patterns were found on the axes and large battle-axes. These are the typical characteristics of the Ba, an ethnic group living in the Three Gorges region (Qutang Gorge, Wu Gorge and Xiling Gorge of the Yangtze river) through the Shang Dynasty to the Qin Dynasty.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nThe location map of Lijiaba site [12]\n\nRecent research has been undertaken on the bronzes unearthed in the Three Gorges region, focusing on the elemental/composition and metallography of the metals, and production technology of the bronze artifacts [14, 15], but very limited research has been carried out on their corrosion products. As part of the program of conservation of the bronzes, their corrosion was investigated.The bronzes unearthed at Lijiaba were found covered in corrosion, and were stored without any environmental control until 2013. Following this they were moved to a new store with controlled constant temperature and humidity. The characterization of the corrosion products is therefore particularly important for a better understanding of the condition and stability of the bronzes, an understanding of the corrosive environment they experienced in the past, and possible conservation and restoration in future. It will serve as baseline against which any future changes may be identified.Raman spectroscopy is an ideal technique for the study for the investigation of works of art and their degradation products because it is extremely reliable, sensitive, compound-specific and is non-destructive. Hence it has been used frequently in the analysis of corrosion products on bronze [16\u201319]. In the present study, Raman spectroscopy supplemented by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used to identify the corrosion products grown on three bronze swords excavated at Lijiaba.\nMaterials and methodsThe swords for analysis were unearthed from different tombs dating to the Warring States period: YLS1 (archaeological excavation number: 00YLIIM82:2) was excavated in 2000, whereas YLS2 (98YLIIM10:1) and YLS3 (98YLIIM11:4) were unearthed in 1998. Corrosion product samples, selected from each of the three swords according to their color and morphology, are listed in Table\u00a01, with the positions on the swords shown in Fig.\u00a02.Table\u00a01\nSamples studied\nSample numberArchaeological numberSample areaDescriptionYLS1-100YLIIM82:2a in Fig.\u00a02ABrownYLS1-200YLIIM82:2b in Fig.\u00a02AGreenYLS1-300YLIIM82:2c in Fig.\u00a02AGrey greenYLS1-400YLIIM82:2d in Fig.\u00a02AGreen, whiteYLS2-198YLIIM10:1a in Fig.\u00a02BGrey greenYLS2-298YLIIM10:1b in Fig.\u00a02BBrownYLS3-198YLIIM11:4a in Fig.\u00a02CGrey greenYLS3-298YLIIM11:4b in Fig.\u00a02CGreen, red, brown\n\n\nFig.\u00a02\nBronze swords unearthed at Lijiaba site, showing sampling locations (A 00YLIIM82:2, B 98YLIIM10:1, C 98YLIIM11:4)\n\nA Renishaw inVia Raman microscope system was used to record the Raman spectrum of samples at room temperature. The spectra were recorded from 1300 to 60\u00a0cm\u22121 in static mode with a laser wavelength of 532\u00a0nm and 50\u00d7 objective lens. Laser power was chosen for emission at 1% power, about 0.5\u00a0mW. The integration time was 10\u00a0s, and the number of collected accumulations was from 1 to 10 depending on the sample. Repeat measurements were carried out on different areas of the samples. All spectra were baseline corrected in the software.Semi-quantitative elemental analysis was performed on solid corrosion product samples using a Shimadzu XRF-1800 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a rhodium (Rh) target. The tube voltage was 40\u00a0kV, and the current was 95\u00a0mA. The analysis area measured is 3\u00a0mm in diameter.Soil samples from the surfaces of the swords were insufficient for analysis, but soils attached to artefacts in the same or nearby burials were available. Soil was removed from the surfaces of bronze artefacts and ground and sieved through 60 mesh. Samples of 0.2\u00a0g were dissolved and diluted with ultra-pure water to 25\u00a0ml and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 60\u00a0min, then centrifuged for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant solution was stored in a refrigerator before ion measurement. The solutions were filtered using a filter membrane of 0.45\u00a0\u00b5m and \\({\\text{PO}}_{4}^{3 - }\\) concentrations were measured using a DIONEX AS-DV with AS11-HC, USA [20].\nResults\nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy\nThe XRF analyses (Table\u00a02) show that the main elements present in the corrosion products are copper, lead, tin, phosphorus, chlorine, silicon, potassium, aluminum, iron and calcium. Copper, lead and tin are the main elements of bronzes, while silicon, potassium, aluminum and iron are likely to represent soil which was incorporated during burial. It can be concluded from its high content of Si, Al, Fe and K that YLS1-1 represents a mixture of soil and corrosion, whereas the other samples contain relatively low amounts of soil. Phosphorus was detected in every sample, with the highest value measured at 9.9%. Chlorine was detected in several samples such as YLS2-1, YLS2-2 and YLS3-2 with a content near 1%.Table\u00a02\nSemi-quantitative XRF analysis of samples\nSample numberCuSnPbSiAlFeCaKPClAsYLS1-124.3\u00a012.831.96.48.55.66.22.8\u00a0\u00a0YLS1-271.11.33.84.80.90.86.80.69.9\u00a0\u00a0YLS1-366.525.02.31.70.4\u00a01.1\u00a03.1\u00a0\u00a0YLS1-426.863.08.91.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00a0YLS2-115.761.418.71.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.31.11.58YLS2-221.54.662.32.31.40.50.70.45.01.4\u00a0YLS3-150.938.27.71.30.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.8\u00a0\u00a0YLS3-247.39.134.91.5\u00a0\u00a01.3\u00a03.71.3\u00a0\n\n\nRaman spectroscopy\nCorrosion products were found to be carbonates, oxides and phosphates of the main alloying metals, Cu, Pb and Sn.

The spectrum of sample YLS1-1 (Fig.\u00a03) is typical, where the Raman peaks at 1095, 1055, 751, 720, 599, 566, 535, 511, 432, 355, 271, 219, 181 and 153\u00a0cm\u22121 correspond to the Raman peaks of previously identified archaeological malachite as shown in Table\u00a04 [21].\n\nFig.\u00a03\nRaman spectrum of sample YLS1-1 (malachite and cuprite)\n\nTable\u00a04\nRaman bands of phases identified as malachite (cm\u22121)\nYLS1-1YLS1-3YLS2-1YLS2-2YLS3-1YLS3-2Archaeological malachite [21]1095109410951097109610881093\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 (0\u2013m)1055106910591054105710531061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 (0\u2013m)751752750754750755754\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 (0\u2013m)720718718718718717718\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 (0\u2013m)599598594600598600599\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 (0\u2013m)566567564569563570566\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 (0\u2013m)535534534534534535533\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 (0\u2013s)511510507\u00a0508\u00a0514\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 (0\u2013m)432431431432431432431\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 (0\u2013vs)355355352357352362355\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 (0\u2013m)271270268269270268274\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 (0\u2013vs)219222218216218218217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 (m\u2013vs)181180179180180179179\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 (m\u2013vs)153153152153152154153\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 (0\u2013vs)\nm, medium; vs, very strong; s, strong; 0, not detected\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0(2)\nCuprite\nThe well-defined Raman band present at 218\u00a0cm\u22121 in Fig.\u00a03 is characteristic of cuprite (cuprous oxide, Cu2O) [22] and the peaks observed at 629, 219, 153, 108 and 79\u00a0cm\u22121 in Fig.\u00a03 are also associated with this mineral [22, 23]. The presence of cuprite peaks within the malachite spectrum is a common phenomenon in Raman spectroscopy of archaeological malachite, due to the close association of the two phases in copper corrosion processes [21].\n\n\n\u00a0(3)\nLibethenite\nThe Raman spectrum of YLS1-2 is shown in Fig.\u00a04. According to published data [24, 25], the Raman spectra collected from this and samples YLS1-3 and YLS3-1 strongly suggest the presence of libethenite (Cu2(OH)PO4) as shown in Table\u00a05. This identification is consistent with the XRF results which show high levels of phosphate in the corrosion products. According to the band assignments previously reported [24\u201328], the very strong band at 972\u00a0cm\u22121 may be assigned to the v1 symmetric stretching vibration, whereas the v3 antisymmetric stretching is represented by the strong band at 1017\u00a0cm\u22121, with v2 symmetric bending modes occurring at 386\u00a0cm\u22121 and v4 antisymmetric bending vibrations at 625, 585 and 556\u00a0cm\u22121. A broad band is observed for libethenite at 817\u00a0cm\u22121. The lattice modes appear at 298, 249, 226, 192, 161, 108 and 74\u00a0cm\u22121. (The presence of libethenite in sample YLS1-2 was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction [29]). Libethenite is a secondary copper phosphate mineral commonly found in the oxidized zone of copper ore deposits. It was named in 1823 by August Breithaupt in Lubietov\u00e1, Slovakia after the German name of that locality, Libethen.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nRaman spectrum of sample YLS1-2 (libethenite)\n\nTable\u00a05\nRaman bands of phases identified as libethenite (cm\u22121)\nRaman bands of samplesRaman peaks of libethenite in referenceYLS1-2YLS1-3YLS3-1Frost [24]Kharbish [25]113411351132\u00a0113011011107\u00a0\u00a01102107010691076\u00a010751057105010571050105210171017101610191022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01008972972971975 vs979\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0944855868861862864817823817815818\u00a0\u00a0651645650625625625626625585587580582590556554\u00a0556561457451\u00a0450461429436429\u00a0430386387386387392367\u00a0365\u00a0371\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0319298298298298301\u00a0265\u00a0278270249247248248250226226226226227192193192\u00a0195161156160\u00a0160\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0140108108106\u00a0113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09274\u00a078\u00a074\n\n\n\n\u00a0(4)\nCassiterite\nIt is reported that cassiterite (SnO2) is characterized by strong band at 635 (638) cm\u22121 and weak peaks at 476 and 782 (775) cm\u22121 [23, 30, 31]. The peaks at 640 and 475\u00a0cm\u22121 in Fig.\u00a05 are attributed to cassiterite. The Raman results showed that cassiterite is found in samples YLS1-4, YLS2-1, YLS2-2 and YLS3-1 (Table\u00a03).\n\nFig.\u00a05\nRaman spectrum of sampleYLS1-4 (cuprite and cassiterite)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0(5)\nCerussite\nRaman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of cerussite (PbCO3) or hydrocerussite (Pb3 (CO3)2(OH)2) in samples YLS2-2 and YLS3-2 through the identification of the sharp peak at 1052\u00a0cm\u22121 [23].\n\n\n\u00a0(6)\nPyromorphite\nThe Raman peaks of YLS2-2 (Fig.\u00a06) located at 945, 919, 411, 392 and 105\u00a0cm\u22121 are ascribable to the lead chlorophosphate, pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) [32, 33], whereas the peaks at 1052 and 218\u00a0cm\u22121 are respectively attributed to the presence of cerussite and cuprite [23]. Sample YLS2-1 showed additional peaks at 808 and 770\u00a0cm\u22121 which may reflect the substitution for phosphate in the pyromorphite by arsenic [33, 34] as the XRF analysis of this sample indicated a significant as content (Table\u00a02).\n\nFig.\u00a06\nRaman spectrum of sample YLS2-2 (pyromorphite, cerussite and cuprite)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSoil analysis\nSoil samples collected from the swords analyzed in this article were not available for IC analysis. However, soil samples from the same or adjacent burials were analyzed. Soil from the surface of a bronze spear (archaeological number 98YLIIM11:6) in the same tomb as sword YLS3 showed significant levels of chloride (161\u00a0mg/kg), phosphate (646\u00a0mg/kg), sulphate (498\u00a0mg/kg) and nitrate (386\u00a0mg/kg). The weight of available soil samples on the bronze artifacts from the three tombs (00YLIIM82, 98YLIIM11 and 98YLIIM10) where the swords were unearthed was not sufficient to determine the pH. However, pH values of two other soil samples from close to bronze artifacts 00YLIIM29:8 and 00YLIIM6:4 in the same site were 6.9 and 7.8.\n\nDiscussionChinese bronze artefacts mainly contain copper, tin and lead and the corrosion products of these metals are to be expected. Malachite, cuprite, cassiterite and cerussite have frequently been reported in bronze corrosion products [2\u20139]. Malachite and cuprite are common corrosion products of copper alloys after long burial periods in soils [2]. Cuprite forms a red layer in contact with the metal core. In the presence of H2O and CO2, cuprite will react to form malachite. Cerussite (PbCO3) and cassiterite (SnO2) are the common corrosion products of lead and tin in bronze.From Table\u00a03 it can be seen that no lead corrosion products were identified on YLS1, consistent with the XRF data which indicate much lower levels of lead in the corrosion products on this sword than that of YLS2 and YLS3 (Table\u00a02). Whether this is a reflection of the composition of the underlying alloy is difficult to be ascertain, but given that four samples were taken from YLS1 this appears highly likely. SEM\u2013EDS examination of the metals showed that some swords in Lijiaba site are tin-bronze (with Pb less than 2%), while some are leaded tin-bronze [14, 15]. Lead corrosion products were found on both YLS2 and YLS3, and both pyromorphite and cerussite were detected on YLS2 and YLS3. Phosphatic corrosion products are present on all swords; libethenite on YLS1 and YLS3, and pyromorphite on YLS2 and YLS3 (Table\u00a03).According to Scott [2], who has reviewed the older literature, copper phosphates as corrosion products are not common. However, the reported copper phosphate corrosion products are libethenite (Cu2(OH)PO4), cornetite (Cu3(PO4)(OH)3), sampleite (NaCaCu5(PO4)4 Cl\u00b75H2O), hydrated copper phosphate (cupric orthophosphate Cu3(PO4)2\u00b73H2O) and zapatalite (Cu3Al4(PO4)3 (OH)9\u00b73H2O). Among these compounds the most frequent copper phosphate found as a corrosion product is libethenite (Cu2(OH)PO4) often associated with cremation sites. Recent work has reported both sampleite and libethenite on a Lydian bed of iron, bronze and copper dating to about 505 BC [35], and libethenite was found by Berger on a Nordic bronze dagger from Schoolbek farm, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, dating from the mid-2nd millennium BC [36]. Three bronze arrowheads unearthed at Dachengdun site in Anhui province, China all showed libethenite (Cu2(OH)PO4) in the corrosion products [37] while corrosion on a pair of bronze tweezers wrapped with silk products and buried near a person\u2019s waist in Gansu province, China was found to contain cupric orthophosphate (Cu3(PO4)2\u00b73H2O) [38]. It appears that more frequent analysis of corrosion products on ancient bronzes is revealing more copper phosphates and the present study is in accordance with these findings. According to Mattson [39] and Fabrizi [40], bronzes with copper phosphate corrosion products are rare and less commonly found with copper chloride products which form in an acid environment. The analysis results of the three swords in this paper is in line with their conclusion. The two pH values obtained from Lijiaba site are close to neutral and slightly alkaline while soil from Birka where copper phosphate corrosion products also occur [39] shows a pH of about 8. This is consistent with a pH control on the formation of phosphate corrosion products. Libethenite has been produced experimentally through the reaction \\(2 {\\text{Cu}}^{ 2+ } + {\\text{HPO}}_{ 4}^{ 2- } + 2 {\\text{OH}}^{ - } \\to {\\text{Cu}}_{ 2} {\\text{PO}}_{ 4} {\\text{OH}} + {\\text{H}}_{ 2} {\\text{O}}\\) at pH 7 [41]. Hence the presence of libethenite on the swords from Lijiaba may reflect the pH of the burial environment.Pyromorphite (Pb5Cl(PO4)3) as a corrosion product of bronze has been reported only in the last two decades [8, 42\u201349]. Angelini et al. described some of artifacts coming from the archaeological site of San Polo d\u2019Enza (Italy) coated with a patina containing pyromorphite [42]. Zhang found pyromorphite in the patina of a bronze An (dining table) of the Han dynasty (175 BC) preserved in the Museum of Chenggu [43]. Pyromorphite was identified through XRD in some bronze Roman coins and artifacts found at Tharros (Sardinia, Italy) located along the coast of Sardinia [44], and the authors attributed the presence of phosphorus to the presence of large amounts of decomposing fragments of burnt bone. Mezzi found pyromorphite on bronze artifacts from Tharros (Western Sardinia, Italy) [8] and on Cu-based archaeological artifacts from the Mediterranean basin through XRD analysis [45]. Mata and others found pyromorphite on coins from S\u00e3o Pedro, in Fronteira (Alentejo, Portugal) [46, 47]. Pyromorphite was also found in one bronze arrowhead from Dengzhou museum in Shandong province, China [48] and two bronze dagger-axes of Western Zhou dynasty unearthed in Baoji, Shaanxi province, China [49]. In addition, pyromorphite was found on lead beads unearthed in an Early Bronze Age cost cemetery at West Water Reservoir in south-east Scotland [50].Research into the alloy compositions of Warring States swords from Lijiaba has not revealed the presence of phosphorus [14, 15]. It therefore seems probable that the source of the phosphate ions in the corrosion products was in the burial environment.A comparison of phosphate ion concentrations in soil samples from Lijiaba with those from another site in the Three Gorges region, Tuchengpo in Wushan county, and where copper phosphates were rarely detected, is shown in Fig.\u00a07. The phosphate concentrations in soil samples from Lijiaba are significantly higher than those from Tuchengpo. This is consistent with the expectation that formation of libethenite, a relatively unusual corrosion product, would normally be dependent on the presence of elevated environmental levels of phosphate ions, assuming that there is no internal source in the bronze.\n\nFig.\u00a07\n\n\\({\\text{PO}}_{4}^{3 - }\\) contents of soil samples from bronze artifacts unearthed at Lijiaba site, Yunyang county compared with Tuchengpo site, Wushan county\n\nThe formation of the phosphate compounds libethenite and pyromorphite is therefore related to phosphate in the environment. In fact, these three bronze swords were all buried in close association with buried individuals, specifically close to the human waist, as shown in Fig.\u00a08 for YLS1. The excavation record indicates that no coffin was found in these three tombs and human bones were poorly preserved. Furthermore, the swords were excavated about 1.2\u20132.7\u00a0m below the ground surface, so the possibility that the phosphorus from fertilizer is low. The phosphorus is therefore likely to have originated through the decomposition of human remains. The interaction of the damp burial environment due to the nearby the Pengxi river, the buried human bodies and the bronze promoted the formation of libethenite and pyromorphite.\n\nFig.\u00a08\nPhoto of tomb 00YLIIM82 in Lijiaba site, showing YLS1 (00YLIIM82:2) in the centre\n\nIt might be speculated that phosphatic minerals would tend to form on the swords where the highest concentration of phosphate ions was produced in the decomposition process. On YLS1, libethenite was detected in two samples which were located close to one another on the same side of the sword (YLS1-2 and YLS1-3, Fig.\u00a01). This may indicate an area of the soil particularly enriched in phosphate but a much more extensive sampling regime would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nConclusionThe micro-chemical structure of long-term corrosion products on bronze swords buried at Lijiaba site (southwest China) has been investigated by Raman and XRF spectroscopies.The results show the presence of common corrosion products such as cuprite, malachite, cassiterite and cerussite but also the less common phosphatic corrosion products libethenite and pyromorphite. The occurrence of the phosphatic compounds may be attributed to the practice of including the swords in the burials at the waist, close to the position where they would have been worn during the lifetimes of the buried individuals. Decomposition of the bodies will have enriched the burial environment in phosphate, promoting the formation of phosphatic minerals. There are also tentative indications that the compounds formed reflect the detailed compositions of the underlying alloys but any relationship between the position of the analyzed area relative to the body and the production of phosphates cannot be confirmed from this particular dataset. Overall, however, this study emphasizes the importance of the micro-environment in determining the corrosion products which formed on early metals.In order to obtain more information about the corrosion, we plan to investigate other bronze artifacts unearthed in this site and bronze swords unearthed in other sites and also to analyze the associated soil.Finally, we point out that the gained knowledge is useful to select tailored conservation strategies to ensure the long life of these bronze swords and essential to monitor any long-term changes which may occur during storage.\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsXF performed the analyses, carried out the interpretation of the results and drafted the manuscript.

These highly elaborate objects consist of organic animal protein fibres (silk and wool) and inorganic material (silver or gold and silver gilt metal threads). During their construction, historic tapestries were often woven sideways due to loom width restrictions. Consequently, they are hung in the weft direction when on display rather than the warp direction, which is the structural frame on which the pictorial element is built. Wool fibres are a major structural and decorative component in tapestries and may arguably play a significant role in enabling the tapestries to bear their own weight.\nPrevious researchDuring their lifetime, historic tapestries have been exposed to various physical and environmental changes that pose a risk of damage to their fibres. Concerns for the mechanical stability of historic tapestries led to \u201cthe monitoring of damage to historic tapestries\u201d (MODHT) project through which the highly fragile nature of the tapestries became known [1, 2]. In this European-wide project, a variety of instrumental techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and tensile measurements were used to analyse dyed and unaged model fibres, historic, and artificially light degraded and thermally aged materials [2\u20134]. The results of this research identified several chemical markers of degradation for materials in historic tapestries. These markers included the presence of cystine oxidation products in historic and artificially light aged wool fibres [3].\nChemical stability and the oxidation of historic wool fibres\nA key feature of the chemical structure of wool keratin proteins is their high cystine content. These amino acids with disulfide cross-links are important for the structural integrity of the fibres [5, 6]. Weaker hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between COO\u2212 and NH3+ ions also influence the structural properties of wool. In the assessment of wool degradation, the integrity of protein backbone and crosslinks are the \u201cmain chemical entities of interest\u201d as noted by Weatherall [7]. For this reason, the cystine breakdown products formed from scission of disulfide bonds warrant study for historic tapestries and were investigated in this research. The intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide network is a significant component of the wool keratin cellular substructure [8]. The arrangement of cells within the wool substructure essentially define the physical properties of the fibre, providing resistance to chemical attack.\nThe mechanism for the process of disulfide oxidation in wool keratins is uncertain. One proposed pathway [9, 10] is thought to proceed as described in Fig.\u00a01 with light being one known cause of oxidation, although other environmental risks may contribute. In terms of quantitative detection, lower concentration intermediate products like cystine dioxide (CD) and cystine monoxide (CM) are diminished over time as they are converted to other products [11]. Cysteic acid (CA), a more stable oxidation product is easily identified and has been used as a marker for physicochemical change in historic and model tapestries in the past [3, 12].\n\nFig.\u00a01\nProposed oxidation breakdown pathway for wool keratin drawn in ChemDraw (version 15.1) [9, 10]\n\n\nThrough FTIR, SO and SO2 peaks related to wool oxidation breakdown products (such as CM, CD and CA) can easily be identified. Other peaks relevant to the oxidation process such as the peaks relating to the disulfide (450\u2013550\u00a0cm\u22121), thiol (2500\u20132600\u00a0cm\u22121) or sulfur carbon groups (590\u2013700\u00a0cm\u22121) can appear as very weak bands that may be masked by background noise [13, 14]. Rather such groups are often identified through Raman spectroscopy [15\u201318], where such bands are typically stronger than in FTIR and NIR. Though useful in following chemical changes that occur in wool proteins [19\u201322], FTIR-ATR is ultimately destructive, requiring sacrificial samples that are not always accessible in historic collections. For historic tapestries, it is not possible to take samples from the front of the tapestry. In the MODHT project this sampling issue was addressed by removing fibres from the back of the tapestries. Behind the tapestry the microclimate may differ from that experienced on the surface of the tapestries. Fibres at the back of the tapestries are also better protected from the effects of exposure to light. In FTIR-ATR analysis sample compression is necessary and may cause further physical damage to already vulnerable objects. Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) can be used for a non-invasive approach, however the rough and uneven surface of fibres in tapestries may produce erroneous results and spectra that are difficult to interpret [23]. In previous unpublished research by McCullough1, DRIFTS was unable to produce spectra containing useful chemical information for historic tapestry fragments at Hampton Court Palace.\nFollowing the MODHT project, other studies have investigated the strain experienced by tapestries as well as the chemical degradation pathways leading to the loss of fibre strength. Through finite element analysis, concentrated areas of stress were pinpointed within the slits in the tapestry weave structure (in Ph.D. research by Duffus2 unpublished). Digital image correlation is another method that has been used to non-invasively monitor strain deformation in tapestries while on display [26, 27]. The development of a science based strategy for the conservation protection of the 16th century tapestries in the GH and GWC at Hampton Court Palace led to the establishment of an ongoing long-term environmental monitoring campaign known as the \u201cTudor tapestry environmental protection project\u201d.3 A large number of sensors were deployed in front of the tapestries, where the data collected revealed the distribution of the environmental risks (relative humidity, temperature, light and dust) on these large objects. The strain experienced by the tapestries because of these environmental changes has stimulated another area of this investigation, as well as the development of a non-invasive tool for the in situ condition assessment of the tapestries.\nSince the late 20th century conservation practices for tapestries have evolved from reweaving and restoration to a minimally invasive approach [29, 30]. To evaluate the state of historic tapestries and other historic textiles, condition is commonly described using a visual set of criteria that relies on the conservator\u2019s expertise [31]. Observations are of cumulative damage that has already occurred to the material to the point that fibre strength and image detail of areas may already be compromised. It is therefore difficult to anticipate damage since structural and fibre loss has already occurred and the uncertainty on how best to prioritise the treatment of these objects remains [32].\nThrough non-invasive quantitative assessments, there is the potential to address the need for objective and semi-quantitative condition assessments of historic tapestries by predicting areas that are susceptible to physical and chemical damage. As a technique NIR is non-invasive, portable and easy to use but must be calibrated against reference data. Multivariate analysis is then needed to extract information from both the NIR spectra and measured reference data. On its own NIR, can be difficult to interpret because of the overlapping overtones and combination bands that dominate in the near infrared region. These overlapping bands make it difficult to extract quantitative information from spectra due to the overlap of spectral features in this region (700\u20132500\u00a0nm) compared to the intense absorptions observed from fundamental vibrations in the mid infrared region (2500\u201325,000\u00a0nm) used in FTIR [33]. The condition and physicochemical properties of materials gained through NIR and multivariate analysis has been widely researched in agriculture, the textile industry, as well as in cultural heritage for historic silk and cellulosic materials [34\u201339]. NIR has also been used to determine material quality as seen in the development of partial least squares (PLS) regression models for alpaca wool [40]. As NIR provides an in situ non-invasive approach to understanding the mechanical or chemical properties of a material, NIR was used in a recent study by McCullough to assess the physical damage that occurs to historic tapestries and was based on tensile reference data measured for yarns removed from a collection of historic tapestry fragments housed at Hampton Court Palace (unpublished).\n\nResearch aims\nThe aim of this research was a continuation of the previously mentioned work, focusing on the development of a non-invasive tool to measure chemical damage specifically the oxidation of historic wool yarns. Degradation can be caused by light, though there are other factors that contribute to the oxidation of wool such as temperature, dyes and mordants. The oxidation products formed as a result of cystine scission can result in further fibre degradation through acidic hydrolysis and autocatalytic breakdown processes [6, 41]. Through the examination of the cystine breakdown products and peak intensity changes, the extent of protein degradation can be inferred [20\u201322]. The NIR measurements had already been recorded for the historic tapestry weft yarns in McCullough\u2019s work and are relevant for this research as they were used to calibrate the PLS models against the oxidation products measured in this study. New NIR spectra were then recorded in an on-site non-invasive application to predict the oxidation products of the tapestries on display in the great watching chamber (GWC) and great hall (GH). On-site NIR measurements could be useful in predicting the chemical changes that occur and manifest as fibre strength loss. The knowledge of chemical properties such as the presence of oxidation products may then assist conservators in prioritising areas for treatment using NIR as non-invasive diagnostic instrument complementing existing audit practices.\n\nExperimental\nSampling strategy\nWith permission from Historic Royal Palaces, wool fibres from a sacrificial collection of historic tapestry fragments housed within the scientific laboratory at Hampton Court Palace were analysed (Fig.\u00a02). As the conservation of historic tapestries at Hampton Court Palace has been in practice for over 100\u00a0years, these tapestry fragments are most likely the remnants of past interventive treatments where weak areas were removed and rewoven. The collection of these tapestry fragments constitutes a valuable source of sacrificial samples, presenting similar manufacturing and ageing characteristics to the historic tapestries on display at Hampton Court Palace. These yarns were dyed different colours during original manufacture although the dyes were not identified. Like the tapestries on display, the historic tapestry fragments yarns will have experienced varying levels of light exposure, temperature and RH differences and other environmental parameters. These tapestry fragments were the same sample sets used to develop the previously mentioned NIR model. Where possible yarns were unravelled from the same weft areas adjacent to where they had been removed previously (Fig.\u00a03a).\n\nFig.\u00a02\nExamples from the sacrificial collection of historic tapestry fragments housed at the scientific laboratory at Hampton Court Palace. These pieces had been removed from the tapestries during restoration (image courtesy of Historic Royal Palaces)\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a03\nGraphical representation of methodology on historic fragments. Red and black arrows\u00a0=\u00a0work carried out in this research and blue arrows\u00a0=\u00a0previous work carried out by McCullough (unpublished). a Example of a historic tapestry fragment where yarns removed in earlier work for NIR are denoted as \u201c1\u201d. Yarns removed for FTIR analysis in this research (\u201c2\u201d) were adjacent to previous yarns in \u201c1\u201d. b 3 spectra were recorded per measurement for \u201c1\u201d yarns and averaged for each yarn, c averaged raw NIR spectra for 5 yarns, d 5 adjacent yarns in \u201c2\u201d were unravelled and cut to approximately 0.5\u00a0mm, with 3 FTIR spectra recorded for each piece from one yarn and averaged, e averaged raw FTIR spectra of 5 yarns from area \u201c2\u201d adjacent to \u201c1\u201d. f Multivariate analysis\u00a0=\u00a0principal component analysis and cross validation experiments, g validation of model on validation sets (known oxidation ratios) and independent set (unknown ratios)\n\n\nWeft yarns were unravelled and removed from the weave structure prior to FTIR measurements to reduce the likelihood of spectra being recorded for the underlying warp fibres especially where weft threads had significant material loss. The reproducibility of conducting FTIR measurements on removed historic yarns was assessed in a pilot study for replicate measurements (unpublished results). Five unravelled yarns were removed per weft area in a tapestry fragment with 37 different weft areas of varying condition analysed and 190 unravelled yarns removed in total for FTIR analysis (Fig.\u00a03a, d, e). The yarns were then prepared by cutting to approximately 0.5\u00a0mm in length. Each piece of yarn was analysed separately and the spectra for all pieces from one yarn were averaged.\n\nFTIR-ATR method\nFTIR spectra was collected for 180 yarn fibres from historic tapestry fragments that were dyed a range of colours during original manufacture, for 5 model undyed and unaged wool tapestry yarns and 5 undyed artificially light degraded tapestry yarns (aged at 600\u00a0h of 150,000 lx in a Xenotest light aging chamber) from the MODHT project. FTIR-ATR was used to measure the peak intensities of the functional groups related to cystine oxidation products (see Fig.\u00a03a, d, e). Spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer (Ettlingen, Germany) with an ATR Platinum Diamond single reflection module. Sixty-four scans were collected with a 4\u00a0cm\u22121 resolution over the range of 4000\u2013375\u00a0cm\u22121. Results were processed using Opus software (version 7). The spectra were averaged and normalised by dividing by the amide III absorption band resulting from C\u2013N stretching and N\u2013H bending vibrations at 1232\u00a0cm\u22121 following procedures used in other research [3, 10, 42, 43].\n\nMultivariate analysis\nFor the NIR spectra recorded on-site and previously (see Figs.\u00a03a\u2013c, 4) on the historic tapestry fragments, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied using OriginPro software (version 9.3). A covariance matrix was used to explore variance in the spectra and identify outliers within the data set. The NIR data was mean centred prior to PCA to remove offsets within the spectral data [44, 45]. In this research, the previously measured NIR results were used to create a calibration model using the oxidation peak intensity ratios of wool calculated from FTIR. The PLS models were built separately for three oxidation product ratios, cysteic acid/cysteic dioxide (CA/CD), cysteic acid/cystine monoxide (CA/CM) and cystine dioxide/cystine monoxide (CD/CM) in GRAMS IQ software (version 9.1). NIR spectra were analysed over the spectral range of 1400\u20132400\u00a0nm to remove the effects of dyed samples and to exclude regions where peaks related to wool keratins were not found [46, 47]. The range between 1820\u20131840\u00a0nm was also excluded. Within this region, the detector within the spectrometer switches to cover the full spectral region and is observed as a step in the NIR spectra (Fig.\u00a04). Leave-one-out cross validation experiments were set up where one sample (i.e. fragment weft area) was removed from the training set to select the optimal spectral pre-processing methods. Two methods for pathlength correction of the NIR data were attempted, standard normal variate (SNV) detrend and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC). These corrections account for pathlength changes and scaling effects in the spectra caused by diffuse light scattering [48, 49]. A Norris Gap 1st derivative algorithm was used with 10 points to amplify differences in regions of the spectra collected. The Savitzky\u2013Golay 1st derivative algorithm (SG) was also initially explored but ultimately the Gap 1st derivative produced slightly better correlations between measured and predicted oxidation ratios. When determining the number of factors, examination of the prediction residual error sum of squares (PRESS) or standard error of cross validation (SECV) curves can help to identify the most suitable number of factors for each model. These curves should usually decrease before reaching a minimum as the number of factors increase. The models were selected based on a combination of different parameters. The R2 of the measured vs predicted oxidation ratios for the calibration set was used along with the SECV and PRESS curves, which were examined to determine the optimum parameters and number of factors to train the model. The SECV curves were used to give an initial indication of the behaviour of the model while the PRESS curves were used to fine tune the model. The best models were then chosen from the lowest PRESS, SECV and highest R2 of the calibration set achievable. Each model was later validated using an independent test set of historic fragment yarn samples that had not been used for calibration with known oxidation ratios calculated from the results of FTIR spectra. The R2 of prediction was then calculated for each model from the independent set. The confidence in the model prediction of the validation set was expressed as the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). Grams IQ predict software (version 9.1) was later used to validate and predict separate set of historic tapestry fragment yarns with unknown oxidation product ratios. The software was also used to predict the unknown oxidation ratios of the on-site analysis at Hampton Court Palace on tapestries within the GH and GWC.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nNIR spectrum of a historic wool yarn.

NIR spectra were collected over 100 scans (10\u00a0nm resolution) over a wavelength range of 1000\u20132500\u00a0nm to include the region used in protein determination [50] at around 2168\u20132180\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a04). The visible range was excluded as peaks in this region may be linked to mainly colour properties from the dyes present in the historic yarns rather than molecular changes related to fibre strength properties. A review of the literature did not reveal cystine peaks that could be used directly and while S\u2013H groups have been reported as presenting weak overtone bands [51] in the near infrared (at around 1970\u20131980\u00a0nm), tertiary amides, OH groups and other functional groups can also absorb in this spectral region [52]. For each sampling area, 5 points were measured with 3 repeat measurements averaged at each point (Fig.\u00a05). The results were processed using Indico Pro Spectral Acquisition Software. The NIR measurements\u00a0of the historic tapestry fragments analysed in the previous unpublished report, were performed using the same method and were subsequently used in this study to calibrate PLS models investigated in this research.\n\nFig.\u00a05\n\na NIR sampling area from \u201cthe meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek\u201d in the GH. b The sampling points within the area are numbered 1\u20135. c A microscopic image of the sampling area taken using a DinoCapture\u00ae 2.0 digital microscope.

Conversely the tapestries within the GWC contain no metal threads. Sampling areas were provided from microscopy and digital images taken during a previously conducted dust microscopy survey that took place at the locations of environmental monitors within the GH and GWC. NIR spectra were collected at the lower (0.4\u00a0m height) and middle levels (1.2\u00a0m height) at a spacing interval of approximately 2\u00a0m. Measurements were taken from tapestries along the north and south walls in the GH and GWC (see Table\u00a01). Additional measurements were taken along the east and west wall in the GWC. More measurements were recorded in the GWC because these tapestries were thought to have more variability in the material composition as they are older than the GH tapestries. Areas with varying condition were selected based on the dust microscopy survey and the modified criteria mentioned from the previous work.Table\u00a01\nLocations and description of analysed tapestries within the GWC and GH (courtesy of Historic Royal Palaces)\nRoomLocationCodeTapestryDateDimensions (m)Great hallNorth wallN1The departure of Abrahamc.1541\u2013434.82\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.80N2The separation of Abraham and Lotc.1541\u2013434.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.92N3The meeting of Abraham and Melchizedekc.1541\u2013434.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.90South wallS1The sacrifice of Isaacc.1541\u2013434.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.93S2The oath and departure of Eliezarc.1541\u2013434.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08.54S3Eliezar and Rebekah at the wellc.1541\u2013434.77\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.77Great watching chamberNorth wallN1Romancec.15153.95\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.56East wallE1Triumph of fame over death (triumph)c.15154.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08.10E2The virtues challenge the vices as Christ begins his ministry (Anglesey)c.15154.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.29South wallS1Justice disarmed by mercy (music)c.15153.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05.70West wallW2The death of Hercules (Hercules)c.15153.915\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05.28W3Aeneas departing from Carthage (Aeneas)c.15253.45\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.90\n\n\nResults and discussion\nComparison of peak intensities for unaged, light aged and historic wool\nThe key peaks in FTIR spectra related to the oxidation products of interest can be seen in Table\u00a02. There is a relationship between oxidation products and photo-ageing which can be observed when comparing the spectra for an artificially light aged yarn and historic yarn to an unaged wool yarn (Fig.\u00a06). The FTIR spectra for an unaged and undyed yarn sample had lower peak intensities for what appears to be a mixture of CM and CA components. The artificially light aged sample displays a higher intensity peak for what may represent a mixture of CM and CA or the conversion of the monoxide into the acid. When compared to the historic fibre removed from a sample area in poor condition, this peak is mainly dominated by the presence of CA indicating full conversion towards this product and a more progressed state of oxidation [12].Table\u00a02\nTypical peak absorption frequencies associated with cystine oxidation products [3, 10]\nChemical functional groupChemical namesWavenumber (cm\u22121)\u2013SO2\u2013S\u2013Cystine dioxide (CD)1121\u2013SO\u2013S\u2013Cystine monoxide (CM)1071\u2013\\({\\text{SO}}_{3}^{ - }\\)\nCysteic acid (CA)1040\u2013S\u2013\\({\\text{SO}}_{3}^{ - }\\)\nS-sulfonate1022\n\n\nFig.\u00a06\nFTIR spectra of a historic yarn (black solid line), an artificially light aged yarn (black dotted line) for 600\u00a0h at 150,000\u00a0lx and an unaged undyed yarn sample of wool (grey dashed line). Normalized to 1232\u00a0cm\u22121 amide III peak\n\n\n\nNIR model development\nUsing the NIR spectra collected from historic tapestry fragments as part of McCullough\u2019s previous unpublished study, a model was developed to test whether NIR spectroscopy could be used as a non-destructive tool to predict the ratios of FTIR peaks relevant to oxidation products such as CA, CD, CM. As stated, although FTIR in DRIFTS mode can be used as a non-destructive technique on historic objects, previous work has shown that it is not possible to obtain usable FTIR spectra from tapestry samples using DRIFTS. When using FTIR-ATR, it is necessary to remove yarns for analysis to be able to identify the relevant peaks. FTIR-ATR analysis can thus be considered a \u201cdestructive\u201d technique in this context, with NIR acting as a surrogate technique to predict the outcomes of FTIR-ATR analysis non-destructively. The developed model was validated using a separate training set of spectra, before being trialled on-site at Hampton Court Palace.\n\nPCA spectral outliers of NIR measurements\nPCA was conducted on the NIR spectral data from the previous study. This analysis was necessary to identify possible outliers from spectra that would be introduced into the training set when creating PLS calibration models. The PCA for the NIR data identified fibres from artificially aged, 28.2, 99.1, and 106.1 weft areas as outlier data points that did not cluster with the rest of the group in the PCA score plots (Additional file 1). These points were then considered as potential samples to be removed from the data set during PLS cross validation experiments. The identification of the artificially aged sample as an outlier may be explained by the FTIR results, since the artificially aged samples are potentially at an earlier stage of oxidation than yarns from the historic tapestry fragments. This result also supports the findings from the MODHT project where model samples though artificially aged, were much stronger chemically and physically than the historic tapestries on display (Hacke4 [53] unpublished).\n\nCalibration model development\nThe optimal parameters for the calibration model can be found in Table\u00a03. The models with the lowest correlation were found for the CA/CM ratio. As the monoxide is an unstable intermediate product that is often difficult to detect, it is possible that the intensities were too low or too varied to produce meaningful results. The best calibration models from the leave-one-out cross validation experiments were found for the CD/CM and CA/CD ratios which both had calculated R2 values of measured vs predicted results above 0.6 (Table\u00a03). These results were comparable to the previous work where similar R2 values were reported. A R2 value of 0.6 is inadequate in the case of quantitative applications where high correlations are necessary (i.e. in agriculture and drug applications). These correlations though not excellent, are useful as they help interpret the variability observed in the results for the historic wool fragments. An R2 of 0.69 CA/CD may be potentially acceptable given the complexity of analysing highly variable historic samples, while the remaining correlations for the CA/CM and CD/CM ratios are mainly promising for future experiments with enlarged datasets. To test whether the R2 values were the result of random correlations, a series of permutation tests were performed for each oxidation ratio and repeated 3 times for each ratio. The results of the permutation tests were significantly lower than the original R2 values, confirming that the correlations were not coincidental (Additional file 2). The usefulness of the R2 values is discussed further in the validation of the calibration models. The mahalanobis distance (M-distance) [54, 55] measures the distance of outlier points from the mean of the group samples, according to a scale derived from the variability in the training set. This method was found to be unsuccessful in identifying outliers in cross-validation experiments as none of the samples were identified as outliers except for the model unaged and light aged samples. The M-distance limit is set to 3 which means that samples within the training set that lie outside 3 standard deviations from the group mean, will be classified as separate from the group. Instead the model was optimized by removing spectral and concentration residual outliers using an F-ratio probability that samples differed from the training set by a probability of 99%.Table\u00a03\nOptimal parameters determined for Gap 1st derivative cross validation experiments\nProduct ratioSpectral region (nm)Pathlength correction (1st derivative)SECVFactorsR2\nPRESSNumber of outliers (spectral, residual outliers with F test uncertainty 99%)CA/CD1400\u201318201840\u20132300SNV-detrend0.0970.691.214CA/CM1300\u201318201840\u20132300SNV-detrend0.0340.500.1119CD/CM1400\u201318201840\u20132300MSC0.0760.660.725\n\n\nValidation of the calibration models\nApproximately a third of the historic fragment yarn samples with known oxidation ratios were not introduced to the calibration model and used as a validation set, initially with the unaged and artificially light degraded samples included. The models struggled to predict a value for the unaged wool sample, which reduced the efficiency of the model when initially introduced as part of the training set and appeared as significant outlier when removed from the training set and used for validation. This outlier had the greatest deviation from the slope and difference between measured and predicted results of \u2212\u00a00.55 for CA/CD. Having experienced negligible oxidation, the unaged undyed model samples are unlikely to be comparable to the significantly more degraded and oxidised historic fragments which are over 500\u00a0years old (see Fig.\u00a06). The historic tapestries at Hampton Court Palace have been exposed to an open environment with temperature and humidity fluctuations while on open display over the last century. These fluctuations are in addition to various other environmental risks that have contributed to their fibre weakening and material loss over 5 centuries. The ageing of these historic objects is therefore significantly more complex and cumulative compared to what is simulated in artificial light ageing conditions. The artificially light aged samples are arguably more comparable to the historic fragments than the unaged samples due to the oxidation experienced through artificial ageing, however this oxidative degradation had not progressed to the extent that the historic fragments had degraded (Fig.\u00a06). In fact, during the CA/CD cross-validation experiments (a potentially more progressed state of oxidation) the artificially light aged fibre samples occasionally appeared as outliers. This difference correlates with results from the MODHT where artificially aged model samples (dyed and undyed) remained stronger and in better condition than their historic counterparts. In this research, the undyed unaged and undyed artificially light aged fibre samples are less useful to the models needed to assess historic fibres susceptible to further damage. Both the undyed unaged and undyed light aged samples ignore other parameters that play a role in the degradation of the exposed wool fibres in the historic tapestries on open display (such as the original dyes, their deterioration and subsequent impact on the degradation of wool). Therefore, these model undyed samples which have stronger properties even when some oxidation has taken place for the light aged model samples, are a less useful benchmark and are less representative than the historic fragments for the historic tapestries. However, these unaged and light aged model samples do provide useful insight into how the oxidative degradation process progresses in historic wools. Upon removal of the unaged sample from the validation set, the R2 of prediction was improved. On comparison of the measured vs predicted results for the validation set, all the R2 values for the oxidation ratios were close to 0.6 (Fig.\u00a07). The CD/CM ratio produced the best correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.63) and calculated RMSEP (no units) of 0.06 followed by CA/CD (R2 0.57 of and RMSEP 0.11) and CA/CM (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.58 and RMSEP 0.03). The results from the PLS models, though not excellent are promising as they assist in interpreting the variability observed in the NIR and FTIR results of the historic fragments. With the introduction of larger data sets there is the potential to improve future results. A value of 0.6 may be considered a sufficient correlation as it explains at least 60% of the variance for complex non-homogeneous historic materials. For this research, higher R2 values are not necessarily the goal. It is assumed that there are many factors that influence the degradation pathways for historic wools that are over 500\u00a0years old and the damage they have experience is the result of cumulative effects. Wool fibres themselves can differ chemically by: the age, location, breed of sheep [56] and the resultant macrostructure of wool, by the presence of dyes and dye deterioration over time due to exposure to environmental risks which may increase the rate of oxidation of the wool fibres further. Higher R2 values would be more suitable for more quantitative analyses in areas that require a high degree of correlation, e.g. in agricultural or pharmaceutical applications. However, since we are dealing with complex non-homogeneous materials with varying states of degradation there is a more semi-quantitative element of the research. Therefore, an indication of areas that are more oxidised and potentially more susceptible to fibre loss or damage compared to less oxidised areas is likely more useful to conservators. This information could be then used as a screening tool to target and examine these areas that at risk of damage and prioritise treatment of these areas.\n\nFig.\u00a07\nMeasured vs predicted results of independent validation set in a CA/CD, b CA/CM and c CD/CM oxidation product ratios\n\n\nAn independent set of historic fragments not introduced to the calibration model with unknown oxidation products was predicted in GRAMS IQ predict software. The software determines the efficacy of the prediction using a threshold based on M-distance pass/fail limits. Where values were above 3, samples were flagged as outliers and deemed a \u201cfail\u201d. At values between 1\u20132, samples were described as \u201cpossible\u201d or marginal and below 1 a \u201cpass\u201d or acceptable. Of the 50 independent samples tested, 2 samples failed the limit test. 22 samples resulted in a \u201cpossible\u201d match with M-distances between 1\u20132 and total were tested and 26 passed the threshold limit below an M-distance of 1. This pass criteria gives confidence that the model can be used on independent sets of samples of historic wool fragments.\n\nOn-site trial of the predictive model\nOn-site analysis of the historic tapestries at Hampton Court Palace took place, to trial the developed model in a real heritage setting. NIR spectroscopic analysis of the tapestries was performed and then assessed in relation to the spectra used to develop the model. Unfortunately, the on-site measurements did not meet the pass criteria of an M-distance of 3, meaning that predictions of oxidation products, although possible, were not performed as confidence in them would have been low. The prediction of unknowns also proved to be difficult when the previous specific stress model was applied to these areas. This prediction points to a discrepancy between the developed model and the on-site results. One possible reason for this difference may be explained by the scale of the oxidation product ratios seen in Fig.\u00a07. The ratios varied over small ranges (0.9\u20131.2 for CD/CM) and in some cases had a relatively high error (RMSEP 0.11 CD/CM). This error could translate into a larger error in the on-site trial measurements as indicated by the much higher M-distances that ranged between approximately 4\u201320. Other reasons for the discrepancy in results may relate to soiling differences between the tapestries on display within the GH and GWC and the laboratory historic pieces. There may have been errors in the measurement as the probe was held perpendicular to a vertical surface that was not flush against the wall, compared to the samples used for the model which were analysed on a laboratory bench. The environment may have played a detrimental role as measurements were conducted during the summer and due to its hygroscopic properties, the wool fibres will adsorb moisture from the surrounding air as the humidity increases. Environmental data from the surface of the tapestries was missing as the monitors had been removed prior to the surface cleaning of the tapestries. However, ambient data for the GWC revealed minimum and maximum RH levels of 48 and 65% RH respectively over 1\u00a0week with an average of 58% RH. These RH levels were higher in comparison to 39\u201351% RH when the previous laboratory NIR measurements were conducted. Though it is not possible to control the environment, by excluding the region where bound water appears (1940\u00a0nm) it may be possible to improve results. This research also highlights an issue with using previously conducted NIR results to calibrate the predictive model as instrumental deterioration may have played a significant role in the discrepancy between predicted and measured results. Another important factor that may have played a role can be found in the optics of the spectrometer which are known to degrade over time and after regular use [57]. Since the measurements in this research were recorded 2\u00a0years since the previous model measurements, some wear on the instrument during this time may have contributed to the error observed. To avoid this issue, the instrument should be calibrated against samples with known FTIR data prior to use on-site by conservators to account for such discrepancies.\nIt is possible that the M-distance limit of 3 is unrealistic for this series of experiments. In the on-site trial reported here, M-distance values were well above 3. In some discrimination methods, M-distance limits of 10\u201315 for maximum variance have been reported for classifying samples but threshold values vary according to the type of sample and application [44]. Raising the M-distance limit should therefore be done with some caution. This research therefore demonstrates the complexity of translating a model developed in the laboratory to a real heritage setting. Consistency between the analysis procedure used for both model development and on-site work is paramount, including sample preparation, environmental conditions and instrument performance.\nFor future work, near infrared hyperspectral imaging may improve the relationship between the predicted quantities of oxidative damage to an area within a tapestry, as both spatial and spectral information is collected using a mapping method for the distribution of chemical damage within tapestry areas [58]. To investigate the possible link between fibre strength loss and oxidation a combination of both FTIR and FT-Raman spectroscopy (FTR) could be used. FTR is often used to assess the loss of disulfide functionality in studies of hair and wool [12, 15, 16, 20] since sulfur itself is not NIR active [59]. In combination with the oxidation products measured through FTIR, it may be possible to understand the effects of oxidation on fibre strength more closely.\n\nConclusionIn this research, FTIR was used to examine the cystine oxidation products in wool yarns removed from historic tapestry fragments housed at Hampton Court Palace compared to undyed unaged wool and undyed artificially light aged undyed wool yarns. The level of oxidation of artificially aged wool was found to be lower than that of historic wools, supporting previous research carried out as part of the MODHT that the historic yarns were significantly more fragile than the artificially aged model samples. This research has demonstrated that it is possible to observe the progression of oxidation that historic wools in historic tapestries experience, potentially highlighting areas more susceptible to fibre strength and material loss. In this work, a conservative calibration model was developed using previously measured NIR spectra of historic tapestry fragments and the oxidation products of the same historic tapestry fragments measured in this research. Ratios were predicted for a validation set of historic tapestry fragments with known oxidation product ratios accurate to RMSEP of 0.11 for cysteic acid/cystine dioxide, 0.03 for an oxidation ratio of cysteic acid/cystine monoxide and 0.06 for cystine dioxide/cystine monoxide. Within a laboratory context it was demonstrated that it is possible to predict the unknown oxidation ratios of historic fragments using previous NIR results as demonstrated with an M-distance pass limit of 3, however this prediction does not yet translate to real on-site applications within a heritage context. While there is a known relationship between light induced oxidation and the formation of cystine breakdown products, historic wool yarns in tapestries are non-homogeneous materials having undergone cumulative damage due to exposure to various environmental risks. This oxidation process may have been influenced by the original chemicals treatments to fibres through dyeing and early conservation methods used to treat the tapestries. These risks may have both accelerated the formation of oxidation products and may have produced chemical breakdown products other than those caused by light. For this reason, there are likely other additional factors that influence the relationship between chemical degradation products and strength.The number of different weft areas and subsequently yarns used to calibrate the model should be reviewed as more measurements may be necessary to better represent the tapestries on display. The issue of representativeness becomes amplified when using a predictive model to predict unknown areas that have undergone chemical damage in an on-site heritage application. To improve NIR spectral data collection, the instrument should be recalibrated with the same samples before use if possible. Near infrared hyperspectral imaging may also help to improve the relationship between the predicted quantities of oxidative damage to an area within a historic tapestry, as it allows for both spatial and spectral information to be collected. The environment may play a role in the discrepancy between model and on-site measurements particularly if there was a difference in the moisture content of the fibres. For further research, wavelengths at which moisture plays a role could be excluded during development of the model. It may also be useful to investigate the use of FT-Raman in addition to FTIR spectroscopy as the oxidation products may then be related to the disappearance of the disulfide band which cannot be observed NIR. If calibration of the model is carried out prior to in situ measurement, there is the potential to use NIR as a quantitative non-invasive tool to complement audits used by conservators to quantitatively assess the condition of historic tapestries and other heritage textiles. The addition of the data used to measure the chemical breakdown processes that manifest as a loss of fibre strength and predict such losses may assist in prioritising textile for treatment.\nFootnotes1See Ref.

Nowadays, advanced investigation methods and instrumentation have been increasingly employed in archaeometry studies to determine the origin, date and authenticity of the objects, to detect material deterioration and if possible to understand its causes and mechanisms and to indicate the appropriate conservation and restoration methods or evaluate their effectiveness.Many professionals from various scientific disciplines, such as curators, art historians, archaeologists, conservators etc., are involved in the examination process and diagnosis of Cultural Heritage, each using their own specialized terminology [1]. This, coupled with the fact that the domain of optics and lasers is rapidly growing and constantly improving and updating its methods, as well as broadening its application areas in the Cultural Heritage domain by employing more complex techniques, improved instruments and specialized terminology, makes the description of the methods and results confusing even for the most up-to-date professionals [2]. Consequently, a communication gap among cultural heritage professionals appears which sometimes may lead to misconceptions or misunderstandings. Also, newcomers to this field find it difficult to gain a deep understanding of the use of these technologies and their results, or to select the appropriate method to investigate an issue. Moreover, the variation in the field\u2019s technical vocabulary can be an obstacle for specialists or non-specialists to understand a text, find a proper term, conceptualize a topic or an information need. The latter is highly essential for the in-depth educational review or systematic research on the interdisciplinary domain of optical technologies used for the study of cultural heritage.To resolve this situation, new Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) are needed to enable the efficient cooperation of interdisciplinary working groups. They comprise of an attempt to support individuals in thinking and sense-making, serve both as a guide to other information, but also consist of information sources in their own right [3]. Their conceptual structure allows the effective organization and integration of data, so as to enable their users identifying an object of interest without prior knowledge of its existence [3]. Therefore their use is essential in the above-mentioned field, both for the documentation of the investigation methods and processes, as well as, the provision of related educational material.The goal of this study is to present the supportive role of the semantically linked thesaurus in \u201cPolygnosis\u201d educational knowledge web platform regarding optical and laser-based techniques for advanced imaging, analysis and diagnosis of Cultural Heritage objects. Particularly, the benefits derived from the thesaurus deployment in such an educational context, are outlined.The main contribution of this paper concerns the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus which consists of a method for analysing in depth this interdisciplinary field, acts as an educational resource and provides an effective concept space. \u201cKnowledge Organisation Systems (KOS): short overview\u201d section gives a \u00a0synopsis of the typology of such systems. \u201cThe \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform\u201d section introduces the knowledge platform and illustrates its scope, design and content. \u201cThe \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus\u201d section describes the goals,\u00a0role and concepts of the thesaurus and the methodology used for its construction. \u201cResults and discussion\u201d section reviews the resulting system and provides\u00a0examples of its use, together with the \u201cEvaluation of the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 system\u201d section which aims its\u00a0assessment and proposes further developments. Finally, \u201cConclusions\u201d section presents the main conclusions and contributions of this study, along with its future advancements.\nKnowledge Organisation Systems (KOS): short overviewOver the past 20\u00a0years, many KOS have been developed for serving heritage professionals in the discovery and understanding of new knowledge, and therefore, the support of decision-making, good research and practice. Plenty of KOS with different degrees of vocabulary control, richness of semantic relationships and formality have been implemented so far; each serving slightly different purposes. As follows, they are usually grouped by their structure into three general categories:\n\nTerm lists, which comprise of lists of terms often with definitions, such as Authority Lists, Glossaries, Dictionaries, Gazetteers, Synonym Rings etc. Generally, they do not include a deep organization or complex structure, but they may encompass a limited monohierarchical structure1 that allows simple navigation [4].\n\n\nClassifications and categories, which emphasize the creation of subject sets, such as Subject Headings, Taxonomies and Categorization Schemes. They provide ways to separate entities into broad topic levels based on a particular characteristic, by employing either monohierarchical or polyhierarchical structure2 [4, 5].\n\n\nRelationship lists, such as thesauri, semantic networks, ontologies, which focus on the connections between terms and concepts [4, 5]. Particularly: \n\nThesauri are based on concepts and have a restricted set of relationships among terms, including hierarchy, equivalence (synonymy), and association/relatedness [4, 5]. Most of them employ polyhierarchical structure. Both monolingual [6, 7] and multilingual thesauri [8] are developed according to extensive rules and guidelines, which are given by international standards.\n\n\nOntologies are specific concept models that represent complex relationships among objects and include the rules and axioms missing from semantic networks. From all the systems discussed here, ontologies tend to have the most precise and formal definition of relationships [4].\n\n\n\nTo sum up, most of the above KOS types (such as classification systems, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri) attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain, and thus, they serve for the discovery and understanding of complex knowledge of interdisciplinary fields, such as art conservation.\nThe \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform\nAims and scope\nIn the framework of the NSFR Greek national project \u201cPOLITEIA\u201d (Politismos-Technologia, New Technologies in the Research, Study, Documentation and Access to the Information for Cultural Heritage Objects and Monuments) [9], a web-based knowledge platform \u201cPolygnosis\u201d along with a semantically linked thesaurus, were designed and implemented with educational orientation concerning the state-of-the-art optical and laser-based techniques for advanced imaging, analysis and diagnosis of Cultural Heritage objects.\n\u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform aims to facilitate access to specialized knowledge, serve as a reference tool, and possibly promote consensus on concepts and terms and the move towards a common language for the field. It focuses on assisting primarily art conservators, but also heritage researchers and practitioners with problem clarification on cultural heritage materials. Nonetheless, students in the fields of conservation, archeology or art history can be benefited from this advanced educational web-based resource.\nThe novelty of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform lies in the fact that categorical and factual relationships are central to the intellectual structure of the subject space of this learning system. In this manner, the user is easily navigated from categorical to factual knowledge through the platform\u2019s \u2018Best Practice Guide\u2019, where accumulated knowledge regarding the selection of the diagnostic tool and the\u00a0methodology is presented, with simultaneous display of examples of actual method applications on heritage objects. The model relates those examples to the relevant terminology of the thesaurus, the information about the object under investigation and the data extracted and processed from those procedures. Each of the platform\u2019s case-study presents, discriminates and explains all the knowledge arising from the described\u00a0examination procedure, such as the documentation of the object, the recording of the evidence as well as the conclusions resulting from the evidence.\n\nDesign and content\n\u2018Polygnosis\u2019 system runs on a 3-tier architecture. This allows the separation of the application logic, the data and the user interface,\u00a0while it ensures open architecture, expandability, adaptability and flexibility. The three major independent modules are the database, the functional components and the user interface. The general idea is that data are stored in a central database (\u2018Synthesis\u2019) and users (curators, conservators, technicians, art historians, students, researchers, administrators etc.) can access them through the internet, using the system\u2019s functional components according to the type of access rights they are given [15].\nThe functionality provided by \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 is inspired by CREBITEL3 system [16]. The infrastructure of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 follows the latest research results of open systems and conceptual models. The system\u2019s authorised user may enter, change or delete all the data. The system uses native XML database and all the data are organized and stored in valid XML files following XML schemas [17, 18]. The XML schemas are based on international standards such as ISO 21127 [19]. In this way, the system secures the data preservation, scalability, exploitation and interoperation with others systems.\nFor data and knowledge organization, an ontology of categorical and factual knowledge about the conservation and diagnosis of heritage objects and\u00a0the examination techniques based on laser technologies was created. This ontology is based on the CIDOC CRM (ISO 21127:2014) and its family models CRMsci and CRMdig.\nThe CIDOC CRM is a formal ontology designed to be used as a global schema for describing and integrating metadata about museum collections [14]. The term \u201cmuseum collections\u201d is intended to cover all types of material collected and displayed by museums and related institutions, as defined by ICOM.4\n\n\u2018Polygnosis\u2019 is populated by organized and integrated data, collected from scientific examination methodologies and applications that are being conducted in the laboratory of \u2018Photonics for Cultural Heritage\u2019 of IESL-FORTH. The mentioned laboratory\u2019s investigation methods comprise of Multispectral Imaging, Raman Spectroscopy, Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) [10] and Digital Holographic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DHSPI) [11, 12]. The platform\u2019s design and content mainly focus on:\nThe interpretation and understanding of the possible applications of the described techniques, as well as, their methodologies and instrumentation.\n\nThe various data and images that each technique may produce in pre- or post-processing stage.\n\nThe correlation of the above documentation material with the physical features observed in the artwork along with the feature\u2019s causes or mechanisms.\n\nThe investigation methods in relation to the object\u2019s detected\u00a0features.\n\n\nThe platform\u2019s main concepts, as follows by the conceptual data model in Fig.\u00a01, are [13]:\n\nFig.\u00a01\nThe model and basic concepts of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 knowledge platform\n\na.\nThe implementation of an investigation method\u00a0(\u2018Method application\u2019\u00a0entity).\n\u00a0b.\nThe particular \u201cexamples\u201d, which refer to specific measurement events, examination and diagnosis procedures [14] (\u2018Example\u2019\u00a0entity).\n\u00a0c.\nThe technical examinations, objects and primary data, as well as,\u00a0the secondary data derived from processing the primary data\u00a0(\u2018Technical examination\u2019, \u2018Objects\u2019 and \u2018Data\u2019\u00a0entities respectively).\n\u00a0d.\nAnd finally, the bibliographic documentation and the relevant terminology\u00a0(\u2018Glossary terms\u2019 and \u2018Publications\u2019 entities).\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2 displays\u00a0the homepage of the platform where the user can select his/her content page of interest. The \u2018Best Practice Guide\u2019 illustrates a table of the available examples classified according to the type of evidence that each examination method reveals. Thus, the user can select the case study that interests him either by the type of examination or the type of evidence. Thereafter, the user is provided with descriptive texts (categorical knowledge) regarding the examination type and evidence selected, as well as, a list of examples of related case-studies (factual knowledge) on different heritage objects. For instance, the learner can explore the feature \u2018overpaint\u2019 which consists of an evidence that Multispectral Imaging can detect, in case-studies that examine either a panel painting, a mural painting or a painting on parchment, among other. Therefore, the comparison of the applied methodological approaches, the tools used and the examination results between different material objects, is enabled.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nThe homepage of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 knowledge platform\n\n\nFigure\u00a03 demonstrates a case-study focusing on the identification of the composition of red pigments in a Byzantine mural painting. A\u00a0brief description of the materials studied, the used\u00a0methodology and tools,\u00a0is given in the \u2018Examination\u2019 section [13]. Highlights of the procedure are introduced\u00a0in the \u2018Documentation\u2019 section, along with the results\u2019\u00a0assessment\u00a0of the \u2018Diagnosis\u2019 section.\u00a0Here, the final conclusions, the produced spectra and a map of the analyzed spots are presented together with a commentary text. Subsequently, a list of terms related to this example, as well as, bibliographic and reference sources are displayed.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nExample of the application of Raman spectroscopy on a Byzantine mural painting\n\n\n\nThe \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus\nScope, concepts and role\nIn order to support the platform\u2019s educational role, a set of related-to-the-discipline terms were defined and classified for the development of the semantically linked thesaurus. \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform contains domain concepts linked through a network of well-defined relationships and a rich set of terms identifying these concepts through its thesaurus, which is accessed and maintained via the thesaurus management system \u2018THeMaS\u2019. It concerns an application specific thesaurus that aims to support diagnosis and conservation decision making, as well as, analyse in depth and map out the concepts of this multidisciplinary domain, through organizing them by a faceted classification. Therefore, it provides global subdivision of concepts through Broader-Narrower Term Hierarchy, as well as, it sets concepts and terms into context, relating concepts to terms, and giving definitions. As a result, it offers related concepts the user might not has thought initially, thus help him explore and clarify the information need and find useful related information. Specifically, \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus conceptual structure and data interconnections are better interpreted below in Fig.\u00a04.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nThe conceptual model and semantic structure of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesauri\n\n\n\nThesaurus construction methodology\n\nDesign process and challenges\nThe main challenge that we had to deal with when designing the thesaurus, was matching a user question against a semantic network at the categorical level since generalizations and specializations of concepts are unrestricted. The different scientific communities have different perceptions of the same terms and concepts that were to be incorporated in the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus. Thus, it was crucial to avoid the logical errors and idiosyncratic decisions, which may lead to inconsistencies and consequently would require backward-incompatible restructuring of the classification system and its application. Consequently, the demand for objectivity in designing and establishing the top-concepts of the thesaurus leads us to look for formal rules that would enable ranking the specific terms on the basis of typical criteria. As a result, we have turned our attention to the ontology of CIDOC CRM Model [14].\nAccordingly, an ontology-driven faceted analysis method was used for the definition of the top-level concepts that consist of the backbone for organizing its knowledge. It is critical to point out that it has not been used to define any of the terminology appearing on the thesaurus, but it has rather explained the logic of the documented terms. Due to its structure and formalism, this ontology has assured the ability to integrate terminology from different relevant scientific sources and it has enabled semantic interoperability.\nThe methodology followed for the construction of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus include the following main steps:a.\nData collection and analysis: collection and processing of related scientific sources, terminology and thesauri.\n\u00a0b.\nThesaurus structure: (i) formation of semantic categories and facets of the thesaurus according to the main concepts of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019, (ii) building of hierarchies and finally (iii) formation of the semantic relationships between terms.\n\u00a0\n\nBelow follows a more detailed description of the above mentioned methodological steps.\n\n\nCollection and data analysis\nLike most knowledge organization systems, the thesaurus is the result of processing documents and information resources. The first step is the collection and processing of a set of \u201ccontent objects\u201d5 [20], which will be the primary material used for producing the subsequent homogenized indexing system [6].\nThe documented scientific terminology in \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus is part of the expert languages of the disciplines of art conservation, technical art history, optics and lasers, among others. Thus, the process of selecting terms for inclusion in \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus involved the consulting of various related sources. Each of the studied source, either describes experimental procedures performed for the study of heritage materials (e.g. spectroscopic material analysis), or includes terminology referring to the condition state, degradation processes, pathology, features and components of a heritage object (e.g. detachment, pentimento) or terminology regarding the object itself (e.g. acrylic paintings, murals).\nPrimarily, existing analysis/condition reports from past campaigns that were conducted by the \u2018Photonic for Cultural Heritage\u2019 laboratory of IESL-FORTH were studied in order to identify the terms and concepts that we aim to document in the thesaurus. The \u2018Ariadne\u2019 conservation documentation system\u2019s conceptual model [21]\u00a0has also assisted in the identification of the conservation steps in our analysis/condition reports. In parallel, laser system\u2019s user manuals were analysed in order to collect technical terms regarding the equipment and the digital documentation data.\n\u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus has been based on the experience, structure and content of CREBITEL thesaurus [16]. CREBITEL thesaurus facets include \u201cMaterial\u201d, \u201cEvidence of Technique, Mark and Trace\u201d, \u201cAlteration\u201d, \u201cIntervention\u201d and \u201cInvestigation Methods\u201d. Therefore, both thesauri share common scopes, notions and concepts regarding the examination and conservation methods of artworks, their evidences and the resulting data.\nFurthermore, many terms were taken and defined from other thesauri and vocabularies such as the AAT6 [22], NARCISSE7 [23, 24], CRISTAL8 [25] and EwaGlos9 [26], which actually played a verification role in the final terms\u2019 selection. Finally, a high number of books, related journal articles, condition reports, etc. were studied in order to localize relevant terminology to be included in \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus. The source(s) of each thesaurus term is/are documented as a reference on each term\u2019s identity card in the\u00a0Thesaurus Management System (TMS) \u2018THeMaS\u2019.\n\n\nThesaurus structure\nAfter having collected a great number of terms, we had to deal with the challenge of organising them based on their content and meaning, in other words their intension. The process and method followed in designing and building our thesaurus is the same as the one adopted for the implementation of the backbone thesaurus of DARIAH EU10 backbone thesaurus (\u0392\u0392\u03a4) [27]. This method exploits all the advantages offered by categorical semantics, in order to define the intentional properties11 of the general concepts under which we can subsume more specific terms.\nThereafter the categorisation of terms/concepts, we defined our facets and hierarchies through identifying the intentional properties of the concepts to be classified [27, 29]. The latter properties provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a term to belong to a category and not to be replaced without loss of meaning. It is through the intentional properties of concepts that we can identify hierarchical relationships that will lead to broader categories (facets), which will be used for the classification of the terms [27].\nWithin this framework, four extensible facets relevant to the content of the platform were defined. These facets together with their scope notes are presented below:a.\n\u201cMaterial Objects\u201d: This Facet comprises types of things with a physical substance that constitute complete units and have a relatively stable form with identifiable boundaries in at least one dimension. Such units can be natural or man-made (with regard to the origin), simple or complex (with regard to composition) or consist of parts. In this latter case it is possible that the parts are either distinct and independent from the unit of which they are a part (e.g. a cave on a mountain) or that they have to be defined with reference to the sum of the parts (e.g. chess-chessmen). The definition of this facet is based on BBT [28].\n\u00a0b.\n\u201cInvestigation Methods\u201d: This Facet comprises systematic procedures designed to detect, identify and demonstrate the qualities and characteristics of an object. These methods allow the assessment of the object\u2019s condition state, the study of its structure, material, manufacturing technology, the nature and extent of its damage, as well as, the estimation of the deterioration factors. Often, the aim of these methods is to serve the development of the required conservation methodology and the determination of the type and extent of the necessary treatment. For example, spectroscopic methods, imaging methods etc.\n\u00a0c.\n\u201cIdentifiable Features\u201d: This facet consists of features that are inextricably linked with the objects on which they are found without being themselves autonomous objects. These features result from either forced or impulsive actions or procedures. They can be defined by physical characteristics (geometry, colour, etc.), and can be identified and determined by investigation methods. For example, a trace from a previous intervention, a signature, a sign, saturation of colours in a mural due to the existence of moisture etc.\n\u00a0d.\n\u201cData\u201d: This facet includes digital material that provides information relevant to the documentation of the object (material or information object) and the processes that take place during all stages from the acquisition of primary information, by recording or digitization, to the production of secondary and tertiary information, through studies, interventions, presentations, exhibitions and publications. This facet includes terms like interferogram, infrared reflected image, crack map etc.\n\u00a0\n\nThe mentioned facets are organized in hierarchies according to the IsA relation which dictates that every subsumed term must belong to the same inherent category as its broader concept [30]. Using the IsA relation as the criterion for building hierarchies ensures that consistency is maintained since all narrower terms must possess all the fundamental properties attributed to the broader concepts of the hierarchy into which they are subsumed [29].\nApart from the hierarchies created by the IsA relation, terms are also linked through the associative relationship which covers associations between pairs of concepts that are not related hierarchically.\nBased on this relationship, we achieved to relate an object with:\nThe investigation methods that can most effectively examine it.\n\nThe features that can be detected and identified on this object.\n\nThe data resulting from the examination method applications.\n\n\nAll the above-mentioned relationships are reciprocal between all the associated terms. In this manner, a term acts as an entry node for viewing and understanding a large part of the knowledge in this area.\nEven though \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 covers a wide range of concepts related to the study of cultural heritage by laser technologies, it still remains a specific application-based thesaurus. Although, DARIAH backbone thesaurus (BBT) consists of a coherent overarching thesaurus for the humanities [27], a metathesaurus under which \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus can be aligned.\nPolygnosis uses BBT\u2019s \u2018Material Object\u2019, which is common in the field of conservation/restoration of cultural heritage, archaeology, and history of art. The other three \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 facets: \u2018Investigation Methods\u2019, \u2018Identifiable Features\u2019, and \u2018Data\u2019 can be aligned to BBT\u2019s hierarchies and facets [27], as follows:\n\n\u2018Investigation Methods\u2019 (Polygnosis) can be aligned to \u2018Methods\u2019 (BBT\u2019s hierarchy) under \u2018Conceptual Objects\u2019 (BBT\u2019s Facet). The latter \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 facet according to the CIDOC CRM can also be classified under \u2018Conceptual Objects\u2019 (E28) class. \u2018Conceptual Objects\u2019 comprise non-material, man-made products and information, supported by the use of technical devices that may exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time [14].\n\n\u2018Identifiable features\u2019 (Polygnosis) can be aligned to \u2018Physical Features\u2019 (BBT\u2019s hierarchy) under \u2018Material Objects\u2019 (BBT\u2019s Facet). This \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 facet includes the specific features that might be revealed and identified by the investigation methods, and therefore, it is important that they comprise of an independent facet.\n\n\n\u2018Data\u2019 (Polygnosis) can be aligned to \u2018Information Objects\u2019 (BBT\u2019s hierarchy) and \u2018Propositional Objects\u2019 (BBT\u2019s hierarchy) under \u2018Conceptual Objects\u2019 (BBT\u2019s Facet).\n\n\nTo sum up, the mentioned four facets of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus represent the basic conceptual schema of the domain of diagnostic processes and investigation methods on material cultural heritage objects.\n\n\nResults and discussionComparing to the most sequential, alphabetical or through simple subject headings organization of contents, \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 concept relationships and faceted classification present multiple advantages and have contributed the most in the effectiveness of the thesaurus. Its semantic maps serve in the reorganization, enrichment and consolidation of heterogeneous thematic metadata. Moreover, they function as a base for the creation and maintenance of information. They provide the methodology for creating semantic networks through the interconnection of concepts of different information sources. By providing a standardized method for structuring the educational material, semantic maps support new navigation and retrieval methods, and as a result, new ways of organizing the information.Subsequently, this is evident by the structure of the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus which is presented below:1.\n\nFacet: Material Objects\n\nHierarchies:a.\nMobile Objects (e.g. panel paintings, easel paintings)\n\u00a0b.\nBuilt Environment (e.g. complexes, infrastructure, residential areas, single built works)\n\u00a0c.\nStructural Parts of Material Objects (e.g. pedestals)\n\u00a0d.\nPhysical Features (e.g. mural paintings, rock paintings).\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a02.\n\nFacet: Investigation Methods\n\nHierarchies:a.\nMaterial Analysis Methods (e.g. elemental analysis methods, qualitative analysis methods, spectroscopic methods)\n\u00a0b.\nExamination Methods (e.g. laser interference methods, multispectral imaging)\n\u00a0c.\nNon-invasive Methods (e.g. Holographic Interferometry, Raman Spectroscopy)\n\u00a0d.\nMicro-invasive Methods [e.g. Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)].\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a03.\n\nFacet: Identifiable Features\n\nHierarchies:a.\nConstruction Features (e.g. paint layer, ground, support)\n\u00a0b.\nDeterioration phenomena (e.g. crack, detachment, cavity, bulge)\n\u00a0c.\nEvidential Features (e.g. fingerprint or handprint, imprint of a previous support)\n\u00a0d.\nConservation-Restoration Features (e.g. inpaintings, remains of consolidation material).\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a04.\n\nFacet: Data\n\nHierarchies:\nDocumentation data (e.g. spectral images, interferograms).\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe thesaurus facets allow the coherent and self-explanatory organization of terms. For instance, the hierarchies of \u2018Objects\u2019 Facet (Mobile Objects, Built Environment, Structural Parts of Material Objects and Physical Features) cover the whole range of cultural heritage objects and components. Accordingly, an example of the use of the thesaurus is presented on Figs.\u00a05 and 6. Figure\u00a05 illustrates the card of the term \u2018overpaint\u2019 (including Scope Note, Hierarchy, Broader Term, Related Terms and sources), as well as, Fig.\u00a06 presents the tree representation of the \u2018Construction Features\u2019 hierarchy from the Thesaurus Management System \u2018THeMaS\u2019, in a way that acts complementary.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nThe identity card of the \u2018overpaint\u2019 term, presenting its scope note, information about its hierarchy, broader term (BT), related terms (RT) and sources\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a06\nGraphical representation of the top-term of the \u2018Construction features\u2019 hierarchy from Thesaurus Management System (TMS) \u2018THeMaS\u2019\n\nPolygnosis thesaurus has a clear and easily understandable structure, and thus, it provides a novel approach and path to knowledge through its semantic connections and linking with examples of real examination procedures. The combination of terms\u2019 identity cards which indicate all its relationships, meaning and intent, along with the hierarchical views via tree representations, act complementary for the comprehension of the thesaurus. For instance, the term \u2018overpaint\u2019\u2014which one can easily search and find a description in several glossaries and thesauri- may produce new knowledge in \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 via the system\u2019s semantic connections. The graphical representations of the concepts\u2019 relations support the understanding of a concept, and thus, highlight the thesaurus\u2019s self-explanatory structure that a glossary cannot have. Figure\u00a07 shows an example of such a graphical representation of the term \u2018\u2019overpaint\u2019\u2019.\n\nFig.\u00a07\nThe self-explanatory structure of the thesaurus supports in understanding the concept of a term. For example, \u2018overpaint\u2019 is a paint (layer) on a painting, but it is also related\u2014although different\u2014to pentimento and inpainting. Moreover, \u2018overpaint\u2019 is related to (examined by) Multispectral Imaging, and (analysed by) Raman spectroscopy\n\nDue to the fact that different scientific communities have different perceptions of the same terms and concepts, it was crucial to avoid the logical errors and idiosyncratic decisions when constructing the thesaurus. Therefore, the demand for objectivity in designing and establishing the top-concepts of the thesaurus leads us to look for formal rules such as the CIDOC CRM Model.A projection of Polygnosis thesaurus\u2019s conceptual model on the CIDOC CRM Model reveals interesting correspondences and limitations. To the degree possible, concepts are taken from the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (ISO 21127) entities:\n\u2018Material Objects\u2019 facet maps to E70 Thing,\n\n\u2018Investigation Methods\u2019 facet maps to E29 Design or Procedure,\n\n\u2018Identifiable Features\u2019 facet maps to E26 Physical Feature,\n\n\u2018Data\u2019 facet maps to E73 Information Object.\n\nHowever, there is no \u201cright\u201d approach for planning contextualization strategies of knowledge systems, since based on the scope of each case and the system\u2019s designer, different perspectives will be established. Along these lines, this system imposes its own view and perspective on structuring the concepts regarding the experiments and methodologies described. We regard a link pointing to a relationship or relation as sufficient to imply the domain and range class or domain and range value, as symbolized in\u00a0Fig.\u00a08.\n\nFig.\u00a08\nModel for a Case Knowledge Acquisition by Investigation\n\nFigure\u00a08 indicates the transition from the categorical to the factual knowledge in the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform, as well as, the coverage of the information range of the domain by the facets of the thesaurus. The user knows in advance that by using investigation methods, one can identify physical features on material objects, which can be declared through the data resulted from the whole examination procedure. Through \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 semantic network and the display of actual examination procedures, the user now knows that overpaint on mural paintings can be detected by Multispectral Imaging and documented through a series of spectrum graphs.The interpretation of the picture in combination with background knowledge allows for creating knowledge. This example is quite characteristic for a wide class of scientific knowledge acquisition. Knowledge is produced in an assessment activity, using some investigation method that provides evidence. A categorical theory is used to interpret the actual process that caused the evidence. In \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform, we aim to address a quite similar methodology and concepts on the application of investigation methods for the study of material cultural heritage objects.\u2018Polygnosis\u2019 intends to make the amount and distribution of content completely visible to the user. This is critical for giving the user an understanding of the coverage and completeness of the content provided, and the security that all relevant contents for his/her problem are at one comprehensible place. Fundamental role to that has played the indexing of general knowledge as a specific relationship of individual concepts, the assumed instantiation relationship of actual assessments to the general knowledge implemented by the subject index, and the inferences, together with a careful construction of the hierarchical relationships of the thesaurus.In Fig.\u00a09, an indicative content structure of the platform accompanied by its content pages is displayed. Either path the user will choose to take, will lead him to the same information pages and provide him with the same amount of knowledge. For example, as depicted here, two case-studies (Examples 1, 2) of different investigation methods (Method Applications 1, 2) can study the same material object (Object 1) and have various data (Digital Objects 1, 2, 3) as results. Accordingly, all former pages are linked with the glossary terms\u2019 pages, through which the passage of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 system to TMS \u2018Themas\u2019 is enabled for better understanding and exploring the thesaurus.\n\nFig.\u00a09\nAbove is presented a detailed content structure of the platform along with its content pages. This has been an attempt to describe a possible user\u2019s scenario of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019. Any path that the user will decide to follow on the introductory page will enable him to be navigated in every related information page\n\n\nEvaluation of the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 systemThere is no question that in order for a knowledge platform as \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 to be evaluated, it takes a lot of time of being used by the field\u2019s experts. Nonetheless, there have been already some initial efforts to evaluate the system with the expectation to give a preliminary view of how \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 is perceived. This evaluation also aimed towards making decisions for further platform development. Its objectives were as follows:\nto identify the strongest and the weakest elements of the platform from the perspective of use by learners,\n\nto identify typical scenarios of platform usage in terms of time and place,\n\nto collect information and know-how on the subjects corresponding to the most useful platform elements,\n\nto judge the value of the platform and to prepare the guidelines and suggestions for further platform development,\n\nto collect information about the practical integration of web-based information systems into common issues and challenges of newcomers, students, professionals and researchers in the field of conservation science.\n\nTowards this end, the first systems\u2019 evaluation was conducted during the workshop \u2018\u2019 Laser SYNTHESIS and POLYGNOSIS; The POLITEIA Documentation System and Knowledge Platform\u2019\u2019 that took place at FORTH in November 2015. The workshop\u2019s participants were young researchers, scholars, graduate students and professionals with a background in optics, material, computer and conservation science disciplines. The course lasted for 5\u00a0days including 2\u00a0days of hands-on sessions and 3\u00a0days of lectures related to \u2018Polygnosis\u2019, TMS \u2018Themas\u2019 and \u2018Synthesis\u2019 systems. The participants had also the opportunity to curate data for inclusion in the systems from analysis and conservation reports. At the end, open-ended questions were being asked to the participants through questionnaires and an extended discussion took place regarding the systems\u2019 aim, functionality and use.After analyzing participants\u2019 feedback, the evaluation emphasized the importance of semantic presentation forms and design as the key issue for a good learning platform with the relatively smaller importance of material quality and amount at this initial stage. Furthermore, the need for easier data curating and uploading in the central data base (\u2018Synthesis\u2019), as well as, a more straightforward and clear structure for its entities was highlighted. After all, the whole idea of such a system for creating a common language in this field was appreciated.Thereafter at a more mature state, another evaluation workshop was conducted in the Department of Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Arts in TEI of Athens on May 2017 and was accumulated by 19 participants that were conservation students, graduates and professionals. The basic principles governing the knowledge platform and the thesaurus along with the project\u2019s aim and results, were discussed. Moreover, both the \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform and the \u2018Themas\u2019 TMS were presented and explained in one-to-one person, and everyone engaged at least 2\u00a0h in hands-on use of the systems. Moreover, the evaluation methods for the given conditions were questionnaires, interviews, and observations.To begin with, the first chapter of the given questionnaires is focused on the evaluation of the content and the presentational aspects of the platform. The educational content assessment includes material completeness, exactness, relevance, clarity, scientific value and length of material, acknowledgments/references, and illustrative richness. The presentation aspects include screen design quality, easy access to learning objects, proper structural organization, presentation simplicity, proper headlines and titles, quality of illustrations. The criteria are evaluated by five quality ratings: poor, marginal, acceptable, good and excellent. Quantitative summary of some of the given questionnaires\u2019 results is presented in Fig.\u00a010.\n\nFig.\u00a010\nQuantitative summary of the given questionnaires\u2019 results regarding the platform\u2019s content and design\n\nThe evaluation indicated a good level of presentation and navigation simplicity. Among the advantages reported were its structure and the coverage of a broad area of knowledge related to laser technologies for the study of heritage objects, while the most popular elements of the content in use included: the glossary, the objects page and the best practice guide. The drawbacks reported were software instabilities and interface inconsistencies and the need for a more complete and detailed presentation of materials and data.The quantitative summary of the results in Fig.\u00a011 indicated the positive impact of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 in a personalized learning environment. The system\u2019s semantic structure has assisted participants in comprehending knowledge in a centralized way. Nonetheless, some participants pointed out that multimedia interactivity is needed for advancing the learning experience.\n\nFig.\u00a011\nQuantitative summary of the questionnaires\u2019 results for assessing individual learning aspects\n\nOne of the reported\u00a0difficulties referred to the understanding of the interface of the TMS \u2018Themas\u2019 due to the excess of information. Also, 90% of them complied that the thesaurus\u2019s concepts tree representations presented in TMS \u2018Themas\u2019, helped them to better understand the platform\u2019s structure and content.In this respect, it is evident that the overall contribution of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 system in the field was appreciated. The majority of participants found its content relevant to their background and agreed that they would be able to use knowledge derived from the platform in their professional and educational activities. On the question related to easiness and intuitiveness of navigation, 85% of the participants claimed that the platform is easy to navigate. Few of them suggested the inclusion of a tutorial (such as a tool \u2018Help\u2019 functionality) for facilitating their navigation.Furthermore, the evaluation indicated that another strength of the platform is the way of integrating its diversified knowledge by using structured meta-information and formal knowledge description. Specifically, this functionality is served by the thesaurus system that defines the top-level-concepts (facets and hierarchies) -under which the specific terms are subsumed- based on a formal ontology, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (\u201cCRM\u201d). In this sense, the definitions of the facets and hierarchies are not closely dependent on the specific terms of a particular field and so they can be valid regardless of the subject conducting the classifications or the scientific domain to which they refer. Moreover,\u00a0it was agreed that the current thesaurus was valuable throughout their whole educational experience since its presence was very helpful. After interviewing participants and analyzing their feedback, a clear distinction has been achieved between concepts (meanings) included within the platform and their lexicalizations (terms).The users appreciated the structured and logically arranged information that was available for easy access. A major part of the students declared the high value of \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 in facilitating the exploration of new issues, complementary to existing questions, from the platform\u2019s learning process and user navigation. The majority of the unfavorable opinions concerned content quality, which directly related to weaknesses of the content production and review process. Thus, some students recommended introducing a crowdsourcing model for enriching the platform\u2019s content by a wider community of professionals and experts.In terms of time/situation use, \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 evaluation indicated a high potential for individual learning as well as a potential for use during other learning activities (e.g. lectures and seminars in the form of reference material). Depending on context, the material can be used as defined by multiple educational scenarios (e.g. lecture, home-study, search for illustrations etc.). The richness of the presentation contexts serves to simplify learning platform usage in multiple situations. Since many of the critical comments about platform user experience concerned content quality, there was an opportunity to explain why it is often difficult to develop high-quality educational material.The evaluation also considered aspects of functionality from the user point of view. The general conclusion for practical use of multimedia tools in education was that high usability and simplicity of information access should be the focus point of any chosen approach in this direction. The \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 evaluation suggested that after thorough content review, the platform can successfully deliver rich learning content. To conclude, thesaurus design and content so far cover the main conceptualizations of the domain, since it consists of a sufficient information source for understanding the domain without the need of prior knowledge. However, there are many more facets and terms to be included in the thesaurus, such as a \u2018Materials\u2019 facet.\nConclusionsThe \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 platform provides reliable access to highly specialized knowledge. It has the ability to constantly update and merge new knowledge, since its contents are dynamically enriched and semantically organized. It creates a comprehensive environment with respect to a scientific issue. The system enables the comprehension and assessment of knowledge in a centralized, yet personal, way.Moreover, the thesaurus\u2019 faceted classification brings to light hidden connections between the terms and relates concepts. Thus, each term acts as an entry node for viewing and understanding a large part of the knowledge in this area. In this manner, the user can easily explore the learning material following his/her interests, professional needs and pace. Moreover, the faceted classification and hierarchies assist the navigation and querying of categorical relationships through generalization/specialization of concepts. Therefore, the users\u2019 research inquiries can be analyzed and clarified through access to adequate generalizations.\u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus is a never-ending, ongoing project and its development depends on its evaluation and on the involvement of its users. Thesaurus terms can be dynamically enriched and each new term can be classified under the appropriate facet. The method of faceted classification that was selected for the design of the thesaurus allows users to add new terms and hierarchies in a way that will not force us to modify the structure of the thesaurus. Furthermore, this method permits the addition of new facets, as well as new hierarchies in existing facets. Up to now, 4 Facets, 13 Hierarchies and 140 terms have been created and archived in both \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 and TMS \u2018THeMaS\u2019 systems.The networked knowledge organization via hierarchical relationships answer questions and makes paths which leads to new relationships, interpretations and results. Therefore, \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus architecture and semantic relationships lead to a knowledge representation approach which has a major educational role. Graphic views act as a great educational tool since they reveal the higher and narrowed terms and give an easy understanding of the thesaurus structure by guide terms criteria. The thesaurus also offers a self-explanatory structure which is language independent.In conclusion, the system focuses on diagnostic knowledge\u2014specifically on cases where investigation methods are applied to detect features on an object. However, we intend to upgrade its structure and enrich its contents with case-studies related to conservation methodologies that include applications of laser cleaning. Finally, after analyzing the evaluation results, the main future development aspects concern:\nOptimizing of content production, review, and management process with respect to cost and educational efficiency.\n\nExpanding \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 thesaurus content by adding more facets, as well as, terms in existing facets.\n\nAdvancing user\u2019s learning experience with the inclusion of multimedia interactivity and the upgrading of illustrations quality and richness.\n\nInvolving more partners in content production and directing \u2018Polygnosis\u2019 to become a portal for international e-learning resource exchange center in the conservation science field. Towards this end, it is necessary to develop mechanisms that would allow the exchange of users\u2019 assessments, opinions and concepts through an experts\u2019 forum.\n\n\nFootnotes1Monohierarchical structure is the hierarchical arrangement of concepts in which each concept can have only one broader concept and can occur at only one place in the hierarchy, while other broader term relationships have to be shown as related term relationships.\u00a02Polyhierarchical structure is the hierarchical arrangement of concepts in which each concept can have more than one broader concept, thus a single concept can occur at more than one place in the hierarchy.\u00a03CREBITEL is a bi-lingual Training Electronic Handbook, which was developed to convey the complex knowledge of using multispectral imaging techniques for conservation planning.

They are precious legacies with historical, artistic, and scientific value. The weathering degree of large exposed stone relics, such as the Yungang Grottoes, is an important indicator for their preservation and a significant parameter that should be determined before the relics are restored [1]. The Yungang Grottoes (Fig.\u00a01), a world tangible heritage site located at the city of Datong in Shanxi Province of China (40\u00b004\u2032N, 113\u00b020\u2032E), consist of 53 Buddhist grottoes (Fig.\u00a01a) and more than 51,000 statues that are noted for their collection of Buddhist grotto sculptures and reliefs from the 5th and 6th centuries. The Yungang Grottoes have been seriously damaged by the long-term adverse effects of natural forces, human influences, and environmental erosion, which pose direct threats to their existence and artistic value and also to the symbiotic social and economic benefits that they provide. Thus, it is necessary to study the weathering degree of the Yungang Grottoes. An accurate representation of the global and local weathering degree of the Yungang Grottoes is especially important for planning restoration work [2]. The methods that are commonly used to measure weathering include electrical, impact echo, Schmidt rebound, penetration-obstruction, hardness tester, and ultrasonic methods [3\u201312]. No one technique can be sufficient. Although these methods can be used to determine the weathering degree of rocks, they are limited in that they require numerous field tests to determine global weathering degree and may result in unnecessary damage to research objects. In addition, it is difficult to measure the weathering degree of small areas with those methods. Therefore, it is necessary to explore and design a quick, nondestructive, low-cost method for weathering degree testing and classification, which can been used as valuable reference for the restoration and protection of relics [7].\n\nFig.\u00a01\nElevation and the portions of the Yungang Grottoes photographs: a elevation of Yungang Grottoes, b aerial view of Yungang Grottoes from Google Earth, and c panoramic photograph from No. 8 grotto to No. 19 grotto and the ultrasonic testing area of the external wall of No. 20 grotto, No. 19 grotto and No. 13 grotto\n\nThe weathered rocks on the external walls of the Yungang Grottoes, which are typically exposed stone relics, were evaluated in this study. First, the weathered zones on the external walls of the grottoes (Fig.\u00a01c) were tested using a nondestructive ultrasonic machine, and the corresponding ultrasonic velocities were calculated. It has been referenced from the Engineering Geologic Mapping Committee of the International Engineering Geology Association and the Laboratory and Site Standard Committee of the International Rock Mechanics Association [13], the longitudinal ultrasonic velocity ratios of the weathered and fresh rocks represent the weathering levels of rocks in the Yungang Grottoes, as well as the classification of the weathering degrees for materials such as marble and granite [14\u201316]. Next, the terahertz (THz) spectra of the weathering samples in the study area were measured using a terahertz time-domain spectrum system (THz-TDS). This is a non-destructive, non-ionizing, high-sensitivity spectral system for synchronous coherent detection using samples weighing only approximately 0.2\u00a0g [17\u201320]. The THz spectral data and the corresponding weathering levels determined by means of the ultrasonic tests were combined as training and test samples. Last, a regression model for prediction of the weathering levels of the grotto walls was established based on these samples using a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The LS-SVM employs a machine learning software package known for its quick operation, strong generalization, and ability to solve various practical problems, such as those involving small sample sizes, over-fitting, and high dimensions [21\u201323]. The LS-SVM regression model obtained as described above is a new, highly accurate, and economical method for predicting the weathering levels of stone relics based on experimental spectral data from weathered materials.\nMaterials and methods\nUltrasonic testing\nAccording to the distribution characteristics of the weathering damage in the external walls of the Yungang Grottoes, most of the cross sections are rectangular and square. Thus, grid-based ultrasonic testing, which is commonly used in preserving cultural relics, was used to measure the weathering layers of the external walls of the Yungang Grottoes (Fig.\u00a01c). The \u201cfixed excitation probe and moving receive probe\u201d and \u201csynchronous movement of excitation and receive probes\u201d methods were used separately. Each test area consisted of at least three survey lines, and every survey line had at least six measured points. The horizontal and vertical distances between adjacent measuring points were 5\u00a0cm. The measured results were recorded according to the grotto number of the test area. For example, the ultrasonic testing results for the No. 20 grotto were recorded using the code number 20. Similarly, the THz spectral measurements were recorded according to the grotto number of each sampling site.\nA wide-band sonic detector was used for ultrasonic testing. The excitation transducer used a 50-kHz excitation probe. The emission voltage, transmission gain, number of sampling points, and sampling interval were set to 250\u00a0V, 36\u00a0dB, 2000, and 1\u00a0s, respectively. In addition, to reduce the air space between the emission probe (or the receiving probe) and the outer walls of the grottoes and to increase the detection sensitivity, normal glue was chosen as the coupling agent. The normal glue is boiled from wheat flour and water at a 1:6 ration under 353\u00a0K, which is availability, suitability for direct use, and quasi-flow structure. Normal glue does not penetrate easily into stones, it does not cause secondary pollution, and it is easy to clean. Considering the unevenness of the testing regions, uneven coating of the coupling agent and variation in the placement of transducers during field ultrasonic, there may be some errors in the test results. Outliers\u00a0in the original ultrasonic wave time (t) data are eliminated before the data analysis using Grubbs\u2019 test. By looking up Grubbs\u2019 tables, we are able to obtain values of G (n0) for use in excluding outliers [for which G is greater than G (n0)]. And G is defined as follows:\n\n$${\\text{G}} = \\left| {\\frac{{\\overline{\\text{t}} - {\\text{t}}_{\\text{n}} }}{\\text{s}}} \\right| = \\left| {\\frac{{\\frac{1}{\\text{n}}\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{{{\\text{i}} = 1}}^{\\text{n}} {\\text{t}}_{\\text{i}} - {\\text{t}}_{\\text{n}} }}{{\\sqrt {\\frac{1}{{{\\text{n}} - 1}}\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{{{\\text{i}} = 1}}^{\\text{n}} \\left( {{\\text{t}}_{\\text{i}} - \\frac{1}{\\text{n}}\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{{{\\text{i}} = 1}}^{\\text{n}} {\\text{t}}_{\\text{i}} } \\right)^{2} } }}} \\right|$$ (1)where \\(\\overline{\\text{t}}\\) is the average of all ultrasonic wave time (t) data, s is the standard deviation, and n0 is the significance level, which was taken to be 5%.\nThe longitudinal ultrasonic velocity (V) of each grid unit of the tested grotto walls are calculated using the t measured by the mobile ultrasonoscope and the mesh scale within the corresponding transmit\u2013receive intervals.\n\nTHz spectral measurement\n\nSample preparation\nTo minimize damage to the relics, three small weathering samples were collected from the ultrasonic testing regions (Fig.\u00a01c) and then ground evenly with an agate mortar. Each powder sample was marked according to the grotto number. To reduce the scattering effect of the test sample, 0.1\u00a0g of a standard ground sample was mixed with 0.1\u00a0g of polyethylene powder (1:1) and then sieved by filtering with 200-eye sieves. Each sample was then compressed into a round tablet (diameter: 1.3\u00a0cm; thickness: approximately 1\u00a0mm) with smooth parallel surfaces used an infrared tablet under a pressure of 5 tons.\n\n\nExperimental setup\nThe spectral data of the weathered samples were collected by transient THz-TDS [24]. A titanium sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser was used to generate laser light sources with a 800-nm central wavelength, 80-MHz repetition frequency, 100-fs pulse width, and 960-mW power output. A p-InAs crystal was used to excite the THz electromagnetic impulse, and a ZnTe crystal was used as the detection crystal. The samples were placed on the focal point between two parabolic mirrors. The setup was placed in a chamber filled with N2 to eliminate the influence of water vapor in the air. The relative humidity was less than 4%, and the temperature was 293\u00a0K.\nThe experimental data conformed to the physical model developed by Dorney and Duvillaret for extraction of the THz optical parameters of materials [25, 26]. THz-TDS can be used to measure the time-domain waveform of the reference and sample signals and then obtain the corresponding frequency-domain spectra using a fast Fourier transform. By comparing the sample and reference pulses, the complex transmissivity (T) can be defined as follows:\n\n$$T\\left( \\omega \\right) = \\left| {\\frac{{A_{{{\\text{sample}}\\left( \\omega \\right)}} }}{{A_{{{\\text{reference}}\\left( \\omega \\right)}} }}} \\right|^{2} = \\left| {t_{N} (\\omega )} \\right|^{2} \\exp \\left[ {\\varphi_{N} \\left( \\omega \\right)} \\right]$$ (2)where Areference is the complex amplitude of the reference, Asample is the complex amplitude of the sample, N is the complex refractive index of the sample, \u03c9 is the frequency of radiation, |tN(\u03c9)| is the transmission coefficient, and \\(\\varphi_{N} ( \\omega )\\) is the related phase difference between the reference and sample spectra.\n\n\nLS-SVM\nDue to its non-linear algorithm, the SVM is particularly adapted to separating samples with similar profiles. And the key to LS-SVM modelling is the selection of the kernel function and its parameters, which have a direct influence on the prediction accuracy. After contrasting kernel functions in the SVM, a radial basis function (RBF) was chosen to train the SVM in this study [27, 28]. The RBF is a nonlinear function that reduces the complexity of computation during training. Different parameters have to be optimized to increase the performance of the algorithm, like the three parameters are a penalty factor (c), an insensitivity loss parameter (\u03b5), and an RBF coefficient (\u03b3). The corresponding effective value ranges of the three parameters were 2\u221210\u2013215, 2\u221210\u201323, and 2\u221210\u2013210, respectively. The double cross-validation (D-CV) method was used to search for the optimum c, \u03b5, and \u03b3 values. The THz spectra of the grotto walls and the regression model for predicting the degree of weathering were obtained in this manner. The prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated in terms of the relative error (RE) of the predictions.\n\n\nResult and discussion\nWeathering level\nBefore the stone relics can be repaired, the degrees of weathering of the different parts must be determined accurately. Thus, the range of degrees of weathering of the stone relics was divided into 10 levels numbered from 1 to 10, based on the longitudinal ultrasonic velocity [13, 15]. The weathering level (LT) was defined as follows:\n\n$${\\text{L}}_{\\text{T}} = 10{-}{\\text{INT}}\\left[ { 10 \\, \\times \\, \\left( {{\\text{V}}/{\\text{V}}_{0} } \\right)} \\right]$$ (3)where the INT function\u00a0rounds the object\u00a0of the function up to the nearest integer, V is the longitudinal ultrasonic velocity of each grid unit of the tested grotto walls, and V0 is the longitudinal ultrasonic velocity of a fresh core close to the No. 13 grotto, with properties similar to those of the other grottoes, measured to be 2963.42\u00a0m/s. The mean longitudinal ultrasonic velocities (V) of some tested grotto walls and the tested weathering levels (LT) are listed in Table\u00a01.Table\u00a01\nMeasurement results for some grotto walls\nGrotto no.V (m/s)LTLPRE (%)21462.24065.786273.5621731821.67444.228475.7117541439.36366.001380.02351857.85744.168454.2112571860.25744.17394.347581698.75154.836313.2738131513.30055.4088.16141880.26043.999430.01425161894.36643.960210.99475171622.02854.998560.0288181476.52465.662685.622201537.06755.245294.9058211720.94754.636987.2604331614.53054.998680.0264351578.52555.035050.701371674.12555.009410.1882391648.49154.882622.3476\n\n\nTHz spectra\nTHz-TDS can be used to measure the real-time waveforms of sample signals directly. Figure\u00a02a shows the time-domain spectra of samples from the grotto walls. The THz time-domain spectra reveal variations in the THz pulse intensity and time delay between the samples\u2019 signals. Different propagation velocities in the samples relative to the reference path give rise to differences in the time delay, while the variation in the terahertz pulse intensity results from sample reflection and absorption, as well as the THz pulse being broadened as the sample dispersion increases. The time-domain spectra of samples can be changed into transmission spectra using a fast Fourier transform and Eq.\u00a02. The corresponding THz transmission spectra of samples from the grotto walls are shown in Fig.\u00a02b. Because a THz wave is sensitive to weak changes in the molecular structure, the transmission coefficients of the different samples can be detected in the terahertz band. By this means, different samples can be distinguished. However, within the testing waveband, no obvious transmission peak was observed in the samples. Therefore, a common weathering classification based on a characteristic peak is inapplicable, and a new classification method have to be developed. And in order to improve the accuracy of the effect analysis of the model, high-resolution THz spectra in the range of 0.6\u20131.6\u00a0THz (Fig.\u00a02b) are chosen, and the corresponding T values are used as training and test samples for SVM modelling.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nTHz spectra of grotto wall samples: a THz time-domain spectra of grotto wall samples, and b THz transmission spectra of grotto wall samples as training and test samples\n\n\n\nEstablishment of SVM prediction regression model\nFirstly, transmittance data for the external wall samples within the 0.6\u20131.6\u00a0THz range (Fig.\u00a02b) are collected from the Yungang Grottoes and taken as the input data. Secondly, the corresponding weathering levels of the samples (Table\u00a01), which is computed by forum 1 with data sifted from Grubbs are produced as the output data. Thirdly, these data are used as a complete data set and converted into the SVMLight format file. The data file is stored as a.TXT file and considered to be the training and testing data set (Table\u00a02), which contain 17 samples in total, each sample has 34 variables.Table\u00a02\nTraining and testing data set\nWeathering levelDataset of T61:0.531322:0.501433:0.48265\u201332:0.0595933:0.0581434:0.0516941:0.779922:0.759653:0.75070\u201332:0.2881333:0.2688734:0.2453161:0.483612:0.441263:0.43144\u201332:0.0235433:0.0166934:0.01482\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201351:0.639832:0.631303:0.60691\u201332:0.1410033:0.1339434:0.1208851:0.745112:0.724803:0.68721\u201332:0.0811533:0.0782734:0.0711351:0.684492:0.659663:0.63610\u201332:0.1572733:0.1493634:0.13489\nThe prediction model was constructed using the preconditioned spectral data and tested against a blind test set. Subsequently, the D-CV method was chosen for determination of the adaptive parameter to avoid overfitting of the data and ensure modelling accuracy and universality. This procedure was performed 17 times with different combinations of data. The prediction model was constructed using the preconditioned spectral data and tested against a blind test set. This resulted in a true blind test with the additional challenge of spectral data. Every model variation was thus trained using 544 (16 samples\u00a0\u00d7\u00a034 variables) spectral data points, with a blind test set of 34 spectral data points. The RE of the model was used to evaluate the ability of the model to predict weathering levels. The optimal values of the three model parameters were determined to be c\u00a0=\u00a016, \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a00.008, and \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a02.0625. The predicted values (LP) and RE values are listed in Table\u00a01. The REs were all less than 8.16%, which indicates that the model is reliable and applicable to predicting weathering levels.\n\nApplication of the regression prediction model\nThe Yungang Grottoes, which are considered a part of world cultural heritage, cannot be replaced; thus, damage to the grottoes during testing is not allowed. Ultrasonic testing is inapplicable to most Buddha carving regions, especially the uneven statues. This limitation means that ultrasonic testing cannot be performed to measure acoustic waves and analyze the degree of weathering for fear of further damage. However, THz spectral measurement through THz-TDS requires just samples weighing only approximately 0.2\u00a0g. Some weathered carving samples as small as such could be obtained outside of the main body of the stone relics. Thereafter, the weathering levels of the regions where ultrasonic testing cannot be predicted by applying the transmittance data of the THz-TDS spectra within the 0.6\u20131.6 THz waveband to the SVMRPM. The transmittance data of the THz-TDS spectra should first be converted to the SVMLight data format before they are put in the SVMRPM as sample data. The THz transmitted spectra of the grotto wall samples with unknown weathering levels used as forecast samples are shown in Fig.\u00a03. The THz spectrum offset in different weathered grottoes samples is mainly caused by the component difference of the samples, and the THz-TDS with the sensitive characteristics for identifying material composition which can effectively distinguish samples with different levels of weathering. The prediction sample set of the transmittance data in the SVMLight data file format is shown in Table\u00a03. The predicted weathering levels are listed in Table\u00a04.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nTHz transmission spectra of grotto wall samples with unknown weathering level as forecast samples\n\nTable\u00a03\nForecast data set\nPredictionDataset of T01:0.621332:0.597853:0.57717\u201332:0.1045233:0.1017234:0.0865301:0.861702:0.841983:0.84928\u201332:0.3736433:0.3514034:0.3212901:0.681592:0.657453:0.63387\u201332:0.0698233:0.0677834:0.0615201:0.632642:0.615013:0.59456\u201332:0.0651033:0.0590134:0.0472101:0.583062:0.553273:0.52540\u201332:0.0867133:0.0774834:0.07191\nTable\u00a04\nWeathering level prediction results\nGrotto No.16293436LP4.9864.1014.9815.3175.148\n\n\nConclusionsPrevious studies on characterization of the degree of weathering of large exposed stone relics have focused mainly on experimental or test analyses, which involve sampling methods that may bring further effect on relics. These methods can only be used to test-safe zones; they cannot be applied to the main parts of such relics. In this study, a SVMRPM is developed to predict weathering levels based on THz spectra and ultrasonic experimental data. The basic principle and algorithm of SVMRPM are used to analyze and predict the weathering levels of stone relics. The prediction results show that the SVMRPM is effective in processing the spectral data despite the fact that no characteristic peak is found in the spectral data and the spectral differences among several samples are small. The SVMRPM based on THz spectral data and ultrasonic experimental data demonstrated good performance, with RE values of less than 8.16%. This would provide a new, highly efficient, and economical weathering test technique for the Yungang Grottoes. The proposed model can also be applied to analyzing the degree of weathering for other stone relics.\nAbbreviations\nLP:\u00a0\npredicted values of weathering levels\n\nLT:\u00a0\ntested values of weathering levels\n\nD-CV:\u00a0\ndouble cross-validation\n\nLS-SVM:\u00a0\nleast squares support vector machine\n\nRBF:\u00a0\nradial basis function\n\nRE:\u00a0\nrelative error\n\nSVMRPM:\u00a0\nSVM regression prediction model\n\nTHz:\u00a0\nterahertz\n\nTHz-TDS:\u00a0\nterahertz time-domain spectrum system\n\nV:\u00a0\nlongitudinal ultrasonic velocities\n\n\n              Declarations\n            Authors\u2019 contributionsYL and TH conceived the study, performed part of the analyses, carried out the interpretation of the results and drafted the manuscript.

Archaeological metals suffer different corrosion events during burial time that may lead to formation of different corrosion layers on their surface with variable thicknesses and chemical compositions. These corrosion layers may form in different forms from a thin multiple corrosion layer to a thick corrosion crust covering remnants of original metal, and in some cases a completely corroded object without any metallic remnant may be discovered [1, 2]. Different parameters affect the corrosion events in archaeological metals that may be related to the metallurgy of the artefact (e.g. composition and manufacture), or the characteristics of the burial soil (e.g. texture, pH, redox potential, soluble salts) [3\u201311].Corrosion of archaeological bronzes in soil environment has been subjected for many researches in last decades. These multidisciplinary studies could be categorized into three main groups:\nStudies about corrosion morphology in buried bronzes [12\u201314],\n\nStudies to identify corrosion compounds and products, phenomena and mechanisms in bronze corrosion [15\u201318].\n\nStudies on the effect of burial environments and soil conditions on corrosion of archaeological bronzes [19\u201322].\n\nUsually, archaeological metals are placed in the soil for a long time period and it makes difficult or even impossible\u00a0to\u00a0follow up the corrosion processes during burial time. In fact, the conditions of the archaeological metals are the results of interaction between metal/alloy and soil that can be observed only after unearthing the objects. On the other hand, soil environment may alter during the millennia that leads to change the soil conditions during burial time; indeed, the soil that is excavated today, may be different from the soil that objects are abandoned in\u00a0it at\u00a0the first time. Thus, study of the soil conditions in archaeological sites and comparing the results with the corrosion mechanism in the excavated materials can lead to better identification of long term corrosion mechanism in archaeological artefacts.The aim of this research is to understand the effect of soil characteristics on the corrosivity of the burial environment as a medium that influences corrosion in the archaeological bronzes. In this paper, the soil conditions are determined regarding to the corrosivity of the soil environment and the effects of long term burial conditions on the corrosion are studied in some excavated bronze artefacts from two archaeological sites from Iran, the Sangtarashan Iron Age and the Haft Tappeh Elamite sites, by analysis different soil parameters and evaluation of soil corrosivity in the sites by using an integrated soil assessment approach based on the data obtained from soil analysis. Finally, the correlation between soil conditions and corrosion mechanism in the bronze artefacts are discussed.\nMaterials and methods\nArchaeological sites\nTwo archaeological sites are selected to study on soil corrosivity and soil effects on conservation condition of archaeological bronze objects. These sites are Haft Tappeh Middle Elamite site (second millennium BC) located in southwestern Iran in the Khuzestan plain and the Sangtarashan\u00a0Iron Age Site (first millennium BC) located in\u00a0Luristan, western Iran (Fig.\u00a01).\n\nFig.\u00a01\nMap of Iran and location of two archaeological sites studied in this paper\n\nThe archaeological soil of Sangtarashan includes two specific parts: the surface soil in black\u2013brown colour with about 20\u201330\u00a0cm depth, apart from the slope of the hill in the northern part of the site that it is about 100\u00a0cm in depth, and the red soil under the black\u2013brown one that is the main soil of the area. This second layer is from ca. 30 to 100\u00a0cm in depth from the surface of the site and is the burial environment in which the archaeological remains were discovered. The bronze objects also are found in the red soil or the interface of the red and black\u2013brown soils. Of course, a very thin layer in dark brown colour is observed over the black\u2013brown soil that is influenced by recent agricultural activities and is very similar to the black\u2013brown soil (Fig.\u00a02a). Furthermore, the Haft Tappeh site has a different situation, apart from a few centimetres upside the surface that are dated to the Parthian\u2013Sasanian period (beginning of the first millennium AD), all of the burial environment (in some areas more than 200\u00a0cm) is dated to the middle Elamite period. The colour of the soil is similar in the surface and in the depth of the Haft Tappeh site (Fig.\u00a02b). The bronze objects are discovered in different depths of the Haft Tappeh soil medium.\n\nFig.\u00a02\na Soil profile in Sangtarashan site and place of finding a bronze object, b an excavation trench, architectural findings and soil profile in the Haft Tappeh archaeological site\n\n\nEstimation of degree of deterioration (Fdet)\nNord et al. [20, 21] suggested an estimating factor to represent corrosion severity in archaeological copper alloy objects, named as the degree of deterioration (Fdet). They classified the objects in five groups regarding to the volume of corrosion occurred and observed in the cross section of\u00a0copper alloy objects. In current study, based on the cross section of selected bronze samples from two sites, a new Fdet was designed including six groups of objects based on the volume of corrosion penetration into the metallic microstructure. It helps to characterize the penetration of corrosion in bronze structure in more details and shows that how the bronze objects are affected by soil environment. Although many bronze objects are discovered from two archaeological sites, 26 bronze samples were selected from Haft Tappeh and 22 samples from Sangtarashan. As mentioned above, the corrosion penetration and Fdet were estimated by observing the mounted cross section of the samples [23].\n\nSoil sampling\nSix soil samples from each site were selected from three different areas to undertake analytical study on soil and estimate soil corrosivity of two archaeological sites. The Haft Tappeh samples were selected from three trenches during the archaeological excavations in 2012 (trenches 27, 294 and 298) [24]. Three samples were selected from the surface of the trenches (0\u201330\u00a0cm of the surface) and three samples from the depth near the archaeological architectural floor of the Middle Elamite period. The Sangtarashan samples were selected from three trenches (trenches J16, E12 and H18) during 2009 and 2011 excavation seasons [23]. Three samples from black\u2013brown surface soil and three samples of red deep soil were selected. The characteristics of soil samples are presented in Table\u00a01.Table\u00a01\nCharacteristics of the soil samples from two archaeological sites of Haft Tappeh and Sangtarashan\nSampleSample typeTrenchDepth of sampling (cm)Munsell codeColourHT.01Surface273010YR 6/4Dull yellow orangeHT.02Deep279010YR 6/4Dull yellow orangeHT.03Surface2943010YR 5/3Dull yellowish brownHT.04Deep29415010YR 7/3Dull yellow orangeHT.05Surface2983010YR 7/3Dull yellow orangeHT.06Deep29818010YR 6/3Dull yellow orangeST.01SurfaceJ16307.5YR 2.5/2Brownish blackST.02DeepJ16805YR 4/4Dull reddish brownST.03SurfaceE12307.5YR 3/1Brownish blackST.04DeepE12905YR 3/3ReddishST.05SurfaceH18307.5YR 4/1Brownish greyST.06DeepH18705YR 4/2Greyish brown\n\nMethods of soil analysis\nThe analytical methods were selected and designed based on two main aspects: identification of soil type and characterization of physico-chemical factors influencing soil corrosivity. Thus, two analytical systems were performed to find different features of the soil in the archaeological sites: instrumental as well as standard and classic analytical methods.\nFirst to remove free water from the soil texture, all samples were dried in the open air [25]. Then the samples were separated into two parts: the first part was used to analytical studies and soil particle size analysis test. The second one was sieved with sieve mesh size of No.\u00a010 (2\u00a0mm) [26] and was used for other tests, including characterization of soluble ions (soluble salts), pH measurement, electrical conductivity test (EC), and measuring soil water and soil organic matter.\nSoil samples were analysed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) method [26\u201328]. For this purpose, 5\u00a0g of each sample were selected and prepared for XRF analysis. The samples were analysed by an ARL 8410 WDXRF analyser. The XRF analyses were carried out on the powder pellets. Also, the phase compounds in the soil samples were determined by X-ray diffraction method [26, 28\u201330]. Also, 4 grams of each sample were powdered and analysed by an X-ray diffractometer MPD 3000 model manufacture by GNR company.\nSoil particle size distribution was measured by the sieve and hydrometer method in samples of two archaeological sites based on the standard method ASTM D422-63 [31].\nWater and soil organic matter (SOM) contents of soil samples were calculated by heating the sieved samples in an oven and then burning off in a furnace (L.O.I) and were measured based on the weight loss during these processes. Five grams of each sample were heat 12\u00a0h in an oven in 105\u00a0\u00b0C and then water content was measured in percent based on loss of weight after heating [26, 32, 33]. There are different methods and variable temperatures to determine soil organic matter in the soil, but to void the effect of high temperature on different soil constituents, heating in 360\u00a0\u00b0C was selected [34\u201336]. Thus, the samples were\u00a0heated and dried in oven then were heated in a furnace in 360\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. The weight change after heating was considered in percent as SOM content of the soil samples [34].\nThe pH of soil samples was analysed by a pH-meter Metrohm 744 model based on ASTM standard test [37].\nThe soil electrical conductivity (EC) may be an important factor showing soil salinity and consequently its corrosivity because it may present the soluble salt content in the soil [38\u201340]. For this purpose, the dried and sieved soil samples were selected and an extract was prepared from each sample with 1/2 proportion of soil and water respectively. This extract proportion was prepared based on the water content measured in the samples [26]. Then, the EC of soil samples was determined in the extracts by a conductometer InoLab Terminal 740 manufactured by WTW Company.\nThe 1/2 extract of soil/water was also used to determine soluble anions in the soil samples [26, 39]. A preliminary qualitative test was done on the soil samples to detect the soluble anions present in the samples, including HCO3\u2212, CO32\u2212, SO42\u2212, NO3\u2212, PO43\u2212, Cl\u2212 [41]. Based on the results of qualitative tests, soluble sulphate, carbonate, nitrate and chloride were measured in the soil samples. To identify the soluble chloride content, titration (Mohr) method was used based on ASTM standard [26, 39, 42]. Soluble carbonate and bicarbonate content also was determined by titration method with sulphuric acid and based on ASTM standard [39, 43]. Soluble sulphate content was determined by turbidity measurement using spectrophotometry method with a SPECTRONIC 20 spectrophotometer manufactured by BAUSCH & LOMB company [39]. Finally, soluble nitrate was measured by ion chromatography method [44].\nThe soluble cations including Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) method [39] on the 1/2 extract of soil/water by using a Perkin-Elmer 2380 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer.\n\nResults\nPrevious results on the corrosion of the objects\nCorrosion mechanism and morphology in the bronze objects of these archaeological sites are studied previously. The result showed that the main corrosion mechanism in the Haft Tappeh bronze collection is active corrosion (bronze disease). The main corrosion products identified in the Haft Tappeh bronzes are copper oxides (cuprite, tenorite) and copper trihydroxychlorides (atacamite, paratacamite); while uniform corrosion with noble patina is observed in Sangtarashan bronze objects with cuprite, malachite and azurite as the main corrosion compounds [45, 46].\nNevertheless, some details should be explained here to find relationship between soil condition and corrosion in archaeological copper alloy objects. Haft Tappeh objects are made of impure copper and tin bronze alloy and are corroded heavily, as many of the objects are corroded completely and no metallic structure is retained after long term burial in the soil environment. As mentioned above, the main corrosion mechanism in these objects is\u00a0bronze disease or active corrosion that is reaction of copper with chloride resulting to form basic copper chlorides and copper oxides [47]. The corrosion morphology of Haft Tappeh objects includes various red, green, white\u2013grey and black corrosion layers in partially and completely corroded objects [46]. The Sangtarashan objects are corroded partially by forming a smooth noble patina on the surface of bronze objects as well as the formation of an external corrosion layer consisting of basic copper carbonates so-called as type I corrosion [12]. This corrosion morphology is occurred in Sangtarashan bronzes by internal oxidation of tin and selective dissolution of copper [45].\n\nSoil appearance\nThe appearance of Haft Tappeh soil samples consist of a fine grained soil with many white particles that may be the remnants of gypsum used as the binder or plaster in the Elamite buildings of Haft Tappeh [48, 49]. Some very fine black particles are also visible in the soil samples that may be charcoal particles\u00a0from burning the site at the ancient time [50]. Soil samples of Sangtarashan are including three dark samples from the surface and three red samples from the depth of the site. Some large white particles are visible in the Sangtarashan soil that may be small pieces of broken\u00a0rocks that are used to build the sanctuary during the Iron Age [51]. Table\u00a01 also presents the colour characteristics of soil samples from two archaeological sites. The colour of soil samples is specified by Munsell soil chart method [52\u201354].\n\nChemical composition\nResults of XRF analysis of soil samples are presented in Table\u00a02. Based on the results SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO and K2O are the main constituents in the composition of all samples. Haft Tappeh soil samples contain SO3 as major and Na2O, and Cl as minor constituents while metallic contaminations are detected in Sangtarashan soil as minor/trace constituents (Co3O4, NiO, MnO, CuO, ZnO). It is evident that the soil samples are similar in each site, although some variations are visible in their composition such as high amounts of SO3 in sample HT.01 in Haft Tappeh or different main composition in sample ST.06 in Sangtarashan.Table\u00a02\nResults of XRF\u00a0analysis of soil samples from two archeological sites (wt%)\n\u00a0SiO2CaOAl2O3Fe2O3MgOK2OSO3P2O5TiO2ClNa2OCo3O4NiOMnOCuOZnOL.O.IHT.0121.825.75.13.83.01.813.60.220.361.20.88\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201322.48HT.0231.126.56.84.23.92.12.20.110.400.140.33\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201322.40HT.0335.726.77.54.74.32.63.10.210.46\u20130.58\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201314.16HT.0432.021.56.43.94.02.60.740.430.380.850.74\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201326.60HT.0528.923.76.24.23.62.64.70.210.390.710.58\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201324.15HT.0629.724.97.05.84.23.02.80.790.510.660.72\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201320.00ST.0130.523.58.87.64.02.20.130.580.720.082\u20130.0350.0670.100.0910.06421.56ST.0233.120.19.17.94.32.10.0740.250.770.0790.930.0370.0680.0970.0940.06520.78ST.0326.024.59.79.14.42.40.0850.460.850.057\u20130.0340.0790.0910.0930.06622.10ST.0430.523.27.77.64.51.70.0820.370.830.053\u20130.0270.0740.0851.80.06221.25ST.0532.322.98.67.53.72.10.0750.480.670.035\u2013\u2013\u20130.041\u2013\u201321.60ST.0655.73.014.511.14.93.40.0540.261.00.035\u2013\u20130.00550.120.0038\u20135.98\nResults of XRD analysis are presented in Table\u00a03. The main compounds in soils are quartz, calcite, dolomite and illite that are detected in all samples. Other commonplace phases of soil such as albite, microcline, hematite, clinochlore and nantronite are identified as soil components in some samples. Significant feature of Haft Tappeh and Sangtarashan samples in presence of different types of calcium sulphate minerals, including gypsum, basanite and anhydrite, especially in Haft Tappeh soil samples. Also sylvite (KCl) is detected as a minor phase in one sample of Haft Tappeh.Table\u00a03\nResults of XRD phase analysis of soil samples\n\u00a0QuartzCalciteDolomiteIlliteAlbite-CalcianClinochloreGypsumBassaniteAnhydriteMicroclineAlbiteNontroniteHematiteSylviteSiO2CaCO3CaMg(CO3)2K(Al,Fe)2AlSi3O10(OH)2\u00b7H2O(Na,Ca)Al(Si,Al)3O8Mg\u2013Fe\u2013Fe\u2013Al\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013OHCaSO4\u00b72H2OCaSO4\u00b70.5H2OCaSO4KAlSi3O8NaAlSi3O8Na0.33Fe2+3(Si,Al)4O10(OH)2\u00b7xH2OFe2O3KClHT.01\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u25a0\u2013HT.02\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013HT.03\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013HT.04\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013HT.05\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013HT.06\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u25a0\u25a0ST.01\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013ST.02\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013ST.03\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013ST.04\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013ST.05\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013ST.06\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2013\u25a0\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u25a0\u2013\n\n\nMeasurement of corrosivity factors\nDifferent factors affecting to the corrosivity of soil environment in archaeological sites were measured to understand the correlation between the soil environment and corrosion events occurred in bronze objects of two archaeological sites. The results are presented in Table\u00a04.Table\u00a04\nResults of determining some factors including soil texture, electrical conductivity (EC) and pH in the studied soil samples\nSampleSoil texture (%)L.O.I (%)Soil conductivitypHSandSiltClayWaterSOMEC (\u00b5s/cm)T (\u00b0C)SoilDistilled waterHT.01197295.272.58775020.37.416.72HT.021467192.011.71378020.37.86HT.031963181.693.4739319.27.94HT.041767161.701.28373020.37.9HT.051962191.772.08744019.97.88HT.062065152.261.14366019.97.66ST.011755283.997.1859420.66.946.89ST.022247313.382.5734820.07.04ST.032145344.026.7834519.37.02ST.043339283.525.7926719.27.02ST.051854284.148.1940519.36.88ST.06846465.176.8035718.76.59\n\nResults of particle size analysis showed that the soils of two sites are different based on three main constituents characterizing the soil types: sand, silt and clay. In Table\u00a04 it is visible that sand amount in surface samples of Haft Tappeh is similar while in the deep samples is partially variable, but sand amount is variable in all samples of Sangtarashan (between 8 and 33%). Nevertheless, all samples could be classified as fine grained soils because of low amount of\u00a0the sand in their texture regarding to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) [55]. Figure\u00a03 shows the soil classification ternary diagram of sand\u2013silt\u2013clay. The measured amount of these main factors in the soil of two archaeological sites are marked on the standard diagram of USDA classification [56]. Based on the diagram, it is visible that the Haft Tappeh soil texture in all samples is more similar than Sangtarashan samples. The Haft Tappeh soil can be classified as silt loam, while in Sangtarashan the soil texture varies from silty clay to silty clay loam and clay loam.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nTernary diagram of soil texture based on Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), showing the type of soil in two archaeological sites\n\nWater content of the soil or water holding capacity is the resistivity of soil in losing water in the dry state and may be present in three forms: free ground water, capillary water and gravitational water [57]. Water content in Haft Tappeh soil samples is variable from 1.69 to 5.27%, while it is more similar in the Sangtarashan samples. Soil organic matter (SOM) is apparently higher in Sangtarashan samples in comparison with Haft Tappeh ones. Also, it is visible that SOM is higher in surface samples of both sites. Figure\u00a04a presents columnar diagram showing water and SOM content in all soil samples. Based on the diagram, it is apparent that the Sangtarashan soil has high water holding capacity and also more SOM.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nColumnar diagrams of soil characteristics measured in the soil samples from archaeological sites, a water and SOM content, b electrical conductivity (EC) of soil samples, c pH of the soil samples\n\n\nElectrical conductivity (EC) of soil extract shows the presence of soluble salts and salinity of soil. Electrical conductivity of soil extract was measured in the samples (Table\u00a04). High measured EC in Haft Tappeh samples shows that the soil of this site is highly saline in comparison with Sangtarashan (despite of sample HT.03). It is visible that deep samples of Haft Tappeh have similar EC, while it has been measured more variable in the surface samples. Also the extract of black\u2013brown (surface) samples of Sangtarashan are more conductive in comparison with the red (deep) samples (Fig.\u00a04b).\npH of soil samples also was measured and the results showed that the pH range is slightly alkaline in\u00a0Haft Tappeh samples while in Sangtarashan is more neutral (near 7) (Table\u00a04, Fig.\u00a04c).\nSoluble anions and cations were determined by different methods explained in \u201cMaterials and\u00a0Methods\u201d section. The results are presented in Table\u00a05. The amount of three soluble anions (chloride, sulphate and bicarbonate) in Haft Tappeh are significantly higher than the Sangtarashan soil while soluble nitrate is detected only in Sangtarashan samples. The high amount of sulphate of Haft Tappeh samples may be related to the presence of high amount of SO3 determined in XRF analysis and calcium sulphate compounds that were detected by XRD method. Soluble nitrate was only detected in Sangtarashan samples; although it has been measured in low amount, but it is higher in the surface sample (black\u2013brown samples). Also the amount of soluble cations (Ca, K, Na and Mg) was determined by FAAS method showing high amount of calcium, potassium and sodium in the Haft Tappeh samples (Table\u00a05). Also calcium concentration is detected more than other cations in Sangtarashan samples. It can be explained that high amount of soluble salts in the Haft Tappeh soil can be correlated with higher EC measured in the soil samples while it has been determined in Sangtarashan samples in very lower level.Table\u00a05\nResults of quantitative analysis of soluble anions and cations carried out on the extract of the soil samples (mg/kg)\n\u00a0Na+K+Mg2+Ca2+Cl\u2212HCO3\u2212SO42\u2212NO3\u2212HT.01226.852.223.86559.23404.84117.1216309n.d.HT.02128.254.818569.2650.52146.415350n.d.HT.03108.8177.67.2614.2377.16170.816218n.d.HT.04155.8231.613.2185.81460.2131.766866n.d.HT.05160.8258.214647.23653.9812216366n.d.HT.06111.2263.213.9539.2636.68136.6415491n.d.ST.0110.314.1325.1680.6617.325.245.296ST.025.515.5415.4272.648.14.763.1228ST.037.17.3915.5448.7416.44.683.819.2ST.045.8511.1411.9435.698.85.1633.8ST.0510.188.3715.8857.4416.935.244.431.2ST.063.987.8324.744.4416.65.048.811.2\n\nDiscussion\nSoil corrosivity\nThe results of soil analysis in studied archaeological sites from Iran (Haft Tappeh and Sangtarashan) apparently presents that the soil environment is significantly different in two sites. In fact, these different burial environments make different effects on buried archaeological copper alloy objects during long-term burial leading to occur different corrosion mechanisms and morphologies in objects.\nPhase composition of soil in Haft Tappeh shows presence of calcite and dolomite (carbonate) as main compounds and also the pH of soil is alkaline. Regarding that, it is possible to classify the Haft Tappeh soil as calcareous [58]. Also, calcium sulphate compounds are detected in the soil of Haft Tappeh beside chloride phase (sylvite). These phases may lead to the high salinity of Haft Tappeh soil that was also proved by EC measurement. On the other hand, the presence of high amount of soluble Cl\u2212 and SO42\u2212 in soil states that this burial environment is a corrosive medium in which severe corrosion may occur in the long-term burial period. In fact, the presence of high amount of soluble salt results in increasing conductivity of the soil and accelerating in electrochemical reactions leading to corrosion of archaeological copper alloys [2].\nAs noted above, soluble sulphate is the main soluble anion was\u00a0measured in the Haft Tappeh soil samples. It may be due to presence of calcium sulphate phases (and high amount of SO3) in the composition of soil because of gypsum used as a binder or plaster in the architecture of Haft Tappeh. Usually the presence of sulphide (metallic sulphide) and its oxidation leads to form sulphuric acid and acidifying the soil as well as decreasing pH [59], but presence of calcium sulphate phases doesn\u2019t change the pH of the soil [26]. In fact, slightly alkaline pH of Haft Tappeh soil is more due to presence of magnesium and calcium carbonates and soluble bicarbonate anion leading to pH about 8. Although, calcium sulphate may also coexist with carbonates in this pH range [26, 60, 61].\nSilt is the main constituent of soil texture in Haft Tappeh that leads to limit absorption of water and air in the soil and also the ability of soil drying is decreased in time. In fact, higher amount of sand may cause increasing aeration and the drainage ability of the soil [22]. The water holding capacity in the Haft Tappeh may be significant due to its texture and regarding to the depth of placement metal objects as well as ground water table (low depth) on this site, it could be an important factor in corrosivity of the soil [62]. Of course, this factor should be considered beside the presence of high amount of corrosive anions in the soil.\nThe soil environment of Sangtarashan site is significantly different with Haft Tappeh one. Type and concentration of soluble salts are different in Sangtarashan and NO3\u2212 is detected as the main soluble salt in the soil. Of course, the concentration of all soluble anions is very low in comparison with Haft Tappeh soil. Presence of nitrate in the soil is in correlation with high SOM determined in the Sangtarashan soil and may be due to agricultural activities during the time. Also, EC is measured as low amount in Sangtarashan soil samples that is related to low amount of soluble salts in soil. pH of Sangtarashan soil is neutral that may be due to low concentration of soluble salts as well as the high amount of SOM [26]. The neutral pH can lead to decrease the rate of corrosion in the soil environment [2]. The texture of soil in Sangtarashan is variable with different percentage of sand and high percentage of clay. Clay may lead to decrease aeration of soil, but sand may lead to penetrate more water and air as well as decreasing water holding capacity and increasing rate of drainage in the soil. Regarding to the depth of placement objects, pH, concentration of soluble salts and texture of the soil in Sangtarashan site, the soil environment could be considered as a non-corrosive or partially-corrosive medium for the archaeological copper alloy object.\nApplication of a numerical model is a very useful approach to estimate soil corrosivity and the effect of soil environment in archaeological metal objects based on different parameters measured in the soil [22, 63]. There are different standard models to estimate soil corrosivity that are used in industrial studies in which the main factors are selected and considered for specific modern metals or alloys. Some important factors for archaeological copper alloys are not considered to design these standard models [64]. In fact, these models don\u2019t consider the conditions of long-term effect of soil and important factors in corrosion of copper alloy artefacts. For example, some models are considered to sulphide concentration as the important soluble anion while it has no effect on archaeological objects in the aerobic soil environment, or type and concentration of soluble salts are avoided in some corrosivity estimation models [65, 66].\nThus, a useful model to estimate corrosivity of soil regarding the archaeological copper alloys was considered in this research. It was designed by incorporating some different exist models to make an appropriate corrosivity estimation model useful for archaeological copper alloys [65\u201370]. The factors considered in this model are including:\nSoil pH (A),\n\nSoil organic matter (SOM) (B),\n\nConcentration of soluble chloride anion (Cl) (C),\n\nTotal soluble salts (TSS) measured in the soil (D),\n\nWater content in the soil (based on water holding capacity and the place of objects in relation with ground water table) (E),\n\nSoil aeration (soil texture) (F),\n\nElectrical conductivity (EC) of extract of the soil (G).\n\nTable\u00a06 shows the factors and the quantity specified for each factor (between 0 and 10). The corrosivity of soil is\u00a0quantified based on the following equation: $${\\text{Soil corrosivity index}}\\left( {{\\text{SCI}}} \\right) = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}} + {\\text{C}} + {\\text{D}} + {\\text{E}} + {\\text{F}} + {\\text{G}}$$ Table\u00a06\nThe factors used to estimate soil corrosivity index (SCI) in the archaeological soil environment\nFactorPointValueMeasurement unitCorrosive factorA39\u00a0<\u2013pH05.5\u2013924\u20135.542\u2013452\u00a0>B0No SOMWeight percentSoil organic matter (SOM)15\u00a0>25\u00a0<C110\u00a0>mg/kgSoluble chloride (Cl\u2212)210\u201350350\u20131006100\u20131000101000\u00a0<D1100\u00a0>mg/kgTotal soluble salts2100\u20132003200\u20135005500\u2013100071000\u2013250092500\u20135000105000\u00a0<E10Under GWTGround water table (GWT)\u00a0+\u00a0water holding capacity (%)Water content8Around GWT4Upper than GWT-Wet soil (>\u00a020%)2Upper than GWT-Wet soil (<\u00a020%)F660Percent of sandSoil aeration44032000G050\u00a0>\u00b5s/cmSoil conductivity150\u20131002100\u20132004200\u2013333633\u20131000101000\u00a0<Total pointSoil corrosivity index (SCI)0\u201310No corrosive11\u201320Partially corrosive21\u201330Corrosive31\u201340Severely corrosive\nThen the soil corrosivity is classified into four groups: non-corrosive (0\u201310), partially corrosive (11\u201320), corrosive (21\u201330) and severely corrosive (31\u201340). Figure\u00a05 shows the columnar diagram of soil corrosivity index of the soil samples analysed in two archaeological sites. It is obvious that the SCI for Haft Tappeh soil samples varies from 27 to 35 and is less than 30 only in one sample. Thus, the Haft Tappeh soil could be classified as severely corrosive soil for archaeological copper alloy objects. On the other hand, SCI is calculated between 14 and 18 in Sangtarashan soil samples showing that the soil environment in this archaeological site is partially corrosive.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nDiagram showing Soil Corrosivity Index (SCI) in the soil samples analysed from two archaeological sites. The soil of Haft Tappeh is identified as severely corrosive while the Sangtarashan soil is detected as partially corrosive soil\n\nThe Haft Tappeh archaeological site is located in the alluvial plain of Khuzestan that includes a southeastern extension of the Mesopotamian plain and a part of the Zagros Mountains to the northeast. The Zagros mountain is drained by several rivers, that have built up large alluvial fans and partially saline mud flats in this plain at the north of the Persian Gulf [71]. On the other hand, the Sangtarashan site is located in the Zagros Highlands with different geological system from Khuzestan plain and it is the most important reason for difference between soil environment in these sites [23].\n\nSoil environment and corrosion of archaeological objects\nTable\u00a07 shows the factors used to explain Fdet in archaeological objects based on the morphology and corrosion penetration on the cross section of selected samples. Figure\u00a06 also shows the columnar diagram indicating Fdet in objects of two sites. The diagram states that Haft Tappeh objects are corroded heavily and about 75% of studied objects are corroded completely and all metal has been transformed to corrosion products while in Sangtarashan samples, less than 50% of metal has been altered during burial time. Although in some samples of Haft Tappeh, Fdet is determined as groups G-1 to G-3 (5 samples) but it is obviously visible that the corrosion is different in two sites.Table\u00a07\nCharacteristics used to estimate degree of deterioration (Fdet) of different groups of copper alloy objects in this study\nCorrosion typeCharacteristicsCorrosion percentageGroupAlmost no corrosionAlmost all of metal is retained<\u00a010G-1Minor corrosionThin internal corrosion layer is exist10\u201330G-2Considerable corrosionConsiderable internal corrosion layer is exist30\u201350G-3Almost severe corrosionInternal corrosion layer more than half of cross section50\u201370G-4Major corrosionSmall part of metal is retained70\u201390G-5Almost no metal coreAlmost all metal has been altered to corrosion products>\u00a090G-6 \n\nFig.\u00a06\nDegree of deterioration (Fdet) estimated in the copper alloy objects from two archaeological sites. It is obviously visible that the corrosion rate and volume in Haft Tappeh objects is higher than the Sangtarashan bronze objects\n\nThe significant finding in the analysis of soil in Haft Tappeh was high concentration of soluble sulphate ion even more than chloride. Nevertheless, the main corrosion products of Haft Tappeh objects are copper trihydroxychlorides and there is no evidence of formation of copper sulphates among corrosion layers [46]. Copper sulphates are the main corrosion products observed in the copper sculptures and monuments placed in open-air urban environments [72, 73], although they may be formed in water containing soluble sulphate [74, 75]. These compounds are rare corrosion products in corroded objects buried in the soil, although there are some reports about identification of copper sulphates as corrosion products in buried objects [76\u201379]. The basic copper sulphates are stable in acidic conditions. By changing the pH of environment to an alkaline condition, they will transform to more stable compounds such as tenorite (CuO) in the open-air environments [80]. On the other hand, these products will transform to copper trihydroxychlorides (basic copper chlorides) in the presence of high concentration of soluble chloride ions [57, 81]. In fact, the main factor of formation of basic copper sulphates in open-air environments is SO2 [81, 82], but because of absence of SO2 in soil environment, it is not probable to form basic copper sulphates as corrosion products in buried objects in the soil of Haft Tappeh.\nFurthermore, the corrosion products identified in Sangtarashan objects are basic copper carbonates (malachite and azurite) [45]. As noted earlier, soluble nitrate was detected as the high concentration soluble anion in the soil samples of this site. Nevertheless, no evidence of copper nitrate compounds was observed in the analysis of corroded objects in this site. It is due to the high solubility of copper nitrate compounds that make them unstable and they are extremely rare as corrosion products in archaeological copper alloys [1]. Furthermore, sulphate compounds are found in the soil of Sangtarashan site, but no copper sulphate is detected in corrosion products of Sangtarashan bronzes. Apart from conditions of formation of copper sulphates that are explained earlier, it is also may be due to low amount of soluble sulphate ions in water of the soil. Unlike Haft Tappeh soil, sulphur is detected as minor/trace amount in the soil of Sangtarashan site (as SO3 in Table\u00a02) and also soluble sulphate ion is determined in very low level (as SO42\u2212, Table\u00a05). Regarding very low amount of sulphate in Sangtarashan soil, it is predictable that copper sulphate\u00a0is not possible corrosion products in Sangtarashan bronzes and commonplace copper carbonates and oxides are found as corrosion products in archaeological bronzes [1, 2, 45].\nBased on the results and their explanation, it could be obviously deduced that the main corrosive factors in the aerobic soil environments are\u00a0the presence of chloride ion and water in long-term burial period. It has been noted in literature that water capacity of soil (including soil texture and soil moisture) and anions (soil composition) such as chloride are very important factors to make burial environment as corrosive media (e.g. [1, 2, 19, 20, 22]). Of course, many factors are considered as factors influencing the corrosivity of soil but chloride and moisture are noted as the main factors that also influence others in the soil. As noted above, the active corrosion has been occurred in the Haft Tappeh objects due to high concentration of soluble chloride in the soil medium while there are other soluble salts in its soil. In fact, the presence of free chloride ion and water is caused to occur severely corrosion in archaeological copper alloy objects, while because of no significant amount of chloride salts (ions) in Sangtarashan soil, only internal oxidation and low rate copper dissolution were occurred in the Iron Age bronze objects in this site. Of course, it is worthy to note that other factors such as pH are very important, but the presence of soluble alkaline earth metals and alkali metals as well as soluble bicarbonate in soil water are led to make pH between 7 and 8 in two sites. On the other hand, other soluble anions such as sulphate and nitrate don\u2019t play an important role in the corrosion of archaeological objects. Of course, it should be considered that factors such as total soluble salts and pH may influence the corrosion rate in the buried objects. Furthermore, it should be noted that although the dating of the two sites (and their soil deposit) differs about 600-700\u00a0years, but the time has no role in corrosion of archaeological metal objects and is not an effective factor in degree of deterioration in archaeological metals. It is observed that the thickness of patina formed on the surface of modern buried bronzes in soil is similar to archaeological buried bronzes [6, 12, 20]. Therefore, soil conditions are the most important factor influencing long-term corrosion of archaeological bronzes.\n\nConclusionStudy on the corrosivity of soil environment in archaeological sites was carried out to understand important corrosion factors influencing copper alloy objects in long-term burial period. For this purpose, two archaeological sites from Iran were selected. The corrosion mechanism in copper alloy objects was studied earlier and it made opportunity to find correlation between corrosion mechanism occurred in the objects and factors influencing soil conditions for buried artefact. Based on the results, the soil environment of two studied sites is completely different based on the corrosive factors and Haft Tappeh soil could be classified as severely corrosive while Sangtarashan soil is a partially corrosive burial environment. The main corrosive factors identified in the Haft Tappeh soil are including soluble salts, especially chloride and sulphate anions and soil texture (water holding capacity) while the soil of Sangtarashan has no significant amounts of soluble anions. Regarding to the results of corrosivity of the soil and corrosion mechanism occurred in the buried copper alloy objects, it could be concluded that soluble chloride and water content are the main corrosive factors that influence long-term corrosion of archaeological copper alloy objects in burial\u00a0environments. Also, application of a numerical approach to estimate soil corrosivity based on different soil factors is very useful to understand soil conditions in archaeological sites to make decisions about conservation of unearthed bronze collections in situ and in-laboratory during and after archaeological excavations.\n\n              Declarations\n            AcknowledgementsThe author is grateful to thanks Prof. Parviz Davami, Sharif University of Technology, Mehri Ghobadi, Dr. Atefeh Shekofteh, Dr. Hossein Ahmadi and Dr. Seyed Mohammadamin Emami, Art University of Isfahan, Dr. Behzad Mofidi-Nasrabadi, Archaeological Campaign of Haft Tappeh, Ata Hasanpour\u00a0and Dr. Mehrdad Malekzadeh, Archaeological Campaign of Sangtarashan and Mozaffar Farhadpour, Choghazanbil and Haft Tappeh World Heritage Site, for their helps to undertake analyses and their comments to improve the result interpretations and the text.\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that no competing interests.\n\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe dataset(s) supporting the conclusions of this article is (are) available in the article.\n\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\n\nFunding\nNo funding.\n\nPublisher\u2019s Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nOpen AccessThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Two ancient Roman silver denarii were selected as test objects to establish whether the proposed digital recording methods can support professional numismatic comparison of features and properties. The coins raise questions concerning their provenance, authenticity, design, purpose of issue and historic usage, but they also pose considerable recording challenges due to their material and surface properties, which are the main focus in this paper.

The case study was undertaken by a group of scientists, cultural heritage researchers, conservators and museum professionals participating in the European network, Colour and Space in Cultural Heritage (COSCH), supported by the programme for European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST-Action TD1201) [2].The test objects for this study were two silver denarii (Coins A and B) portraying Empress Favstina I, wife of Antoninus Pius, believed to be posthumous deification issues of 141 AD. The obverse of both coins shows the bust of the empress, facing right, with raised inscription DIV\u039b F\u039bVSTIN\u039b. The portrayal on Coin A is rather more flattering to a lady who was famous for her beauty. The designs on the reverse faces are different: Coin A shows Aeternitas (or perhaps Urania) holding a globe in her right hand, with palla billowing out around her head, and is inscribed \u039bETER-NIT\u039bS; Coin B shows Vesta, holding the palladium in her right hand, sceptre in left, and is inscribed VES-T\u039b. Each coin is approximately 17\u00a0mm in diameter and 1.5\u00a0mm thick (see Fig.\u00a01). These two ancient Roman silver denarii were selected as test objects to establish whether the proposed optical and spectrometric recording methods and techniques could support professional comparison of features and properties. The coins, as example for this type of object, raise questions concerning their provenance, authenticity, design, purpose of issue and historic usage which have been explored elsewhere. They also pose considerable recording challenges due to their material and surface properties which shall be the main focus of this paper. This article is a report of the case study project and it reviews the techniques employed and summarises the results.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nPhotograph of obverse and reverse of two silver Roman denarii (a, b) depicting Diva Favstina\u00a0(Lindsay W.\u00a0MacDonald, UCL)\n\nFrom a joint meeting with numismatists the following tasks for archaeologists, curators and conservators receiving new coins in their collection became evident (from personal communication from the COSCH Roman Case study meeting on 22 June 2016 at University College London. Participants, see Acknowledgements):(a)\nKnowledge about the archaeological context of the coins, including provenance, site, stratigraphic layer, environment accrual, which also helps dating and authentication;\n\u00a0(b)\nGentle cleaning and conservation of the surface for identification and cataloguing of coins, especially if found in large quantities (e.g., a block-lifted hoard), as well as information about readability and stability of the coin;\n\u00a0(c)\nKnowledge about type of a coin (e.g., portray, legend, border, flipping; shape, diameter, thickness, weight) and changes in time, as well as wear, corrosion and dirt classification;\n\u00a0(d)\nIdentification and comparison of die patterns and tool marks, for information about provenance and workshops; Banker marks, for historical quality control and validation; Mutilation marks, for validation, dislike of emperor, or loss of currency value;\n\u00a0(e)\nInformation about material composition, including elemental characterization (e.g., percentage of silver), which helps to determine origination and to understand economic, political, social issues, such as production, trade, migration, enriching surface layer or forgery;\n\u00a0(f)\nAttribution, classification and description, for research and accessioning into the collection;\n\u00a0(g)\nExamination of authenticity and significance of a coin;\n\u00a0(h)\nMore intense cleaning and conservation towards documentation for an exhibition or specific publication;\n\u00a0(i)\nProduction of visual and analytical evidence/imagery for research, publication and dissemination;\n\u00a0(j)\nStorage of the information in a searchable database.\n\u00a0\nFrom these interviews it could also be concluded that numismatic collections continue to rely on traditional documentation and analysis methods, predominantly manual measurements and 2D photography, which have limited information in terms of dimensional and spectroscopic information. It could also be confirmed that advanced non-destructive methods for recording and examination have increasingly been introduced to conservation and museum practices, in order to complement traditional documentation and analytical techniques, with a view to automation on some of the tasks named above, but are not the norm.This paper summarises outcomes that can be gleaned for numismatics by the use of different heritage science methods and techniques (non-destructive imaging, physico-chemical analyses, but also conservation and data management) used on the exemplary Roman coins, can contribute to meet the tasks of numismatists named above.\nTechniques and methods for documentation and analysis of coinsFirstly, a methodology and workflow was developed for the study. Steps towards a rigorous procedure for documentation include reason(s)/question(s), planning, multimodal data collection, data analysis (extracting knowledge) and interpretation of results according to the questions. Of course, the aims for acquiring data should be clear from the beginning. The availability of particular collaborators and equipment at particular times in this case study, as in every project, affected the order, type, and dates of data acquisition (see Fig.\u00a02, [3]).\n\nFig.\u00a02\nGeneral framework for data acquisition, processing and analysis of historical silver coins (Vera Moitinho de Almeida)\n\nThe following challenges were faced by optical techniques for the selected Roman coins: surface properties, small size, shallow relief, and metallic specularity. This section will first describe the techniques used to document and analyse the coins: (a)\u00a0hands-on inspection and drafting; subsequently selected optical and spectrometric techniques were employed to record the surface details and internal structure of the coins and in particular (b)\u00a0optical non-destructive examination and 3D recording, also including photography and (c)\u00a0complementary physico-chemical methods for material analysis.\nHands-on inspection and drafting\nCoins found on archaeological sites are typically documented by manual drawings, because the draftsman uses his or her judgement to draw only the relevant details. Finds generally have signs of wear, dirt, corrosion, etc. and therefore line drawings have also found widespread use as illustrations in coin catalogues. Digital photography and 2D document scanning with textual accompanying annotation is used to create records of coins, please see below. The finds have to be documented properly, because in general they cannot legally be taken outside the country hosting the excavation.\nThe study of a coin\u2019s features has traditionally been conducted by direct hands-on examination, employing magnification tools and a strong directional light source. By holding the coin under the light, and tilting it relative to the viewing direction, the surface features may be discerned. Unfortunately, security concerns due to the ease of concealment, lack of unique identification, and often high resale value severely limit opportunities for this method of examination. When coins are secured in glass cabinets, even those employing mirrors and magnifying optics, the ability to perceive surface relief is significantly reduced. The quality of numismatic information that can be gleaned from a coin decreases further if in-person examination is not possible. Traditional photographic documentation conveys only a subset of the information discernible through direct physical inspection [4].\n\nOptical non-destructive examination and 3D recording\n\nPhotography\nWidely used in numismatic research and for publication illustration purposes, the use of 2D photography is the most convenient means of documentation and visualisation of coins.\nIn the documentation of coins, images provide additional information besides the written description, conveying both the visual design and the state of preservation. Traditionally coins have been photographed by numismatists as 2D monochrome images, and these are of great qualitative value. But unless a standardized configuration of illumination is employed, it is difficult to use the images for quantitative analysis and comparison. For imaging of pre-modern coins, for example, numismatic photographers have sometimes employed a light source inclined at an angle from the optical axis of the camera. This has the advantage of reducing the direct specular reflections from the metallic surface, but it produces bright reflections from gradients on one side of relief features and shadows on the other. An example of photographs of the two Roman coins is shown in Fig.\u00a01. The images were taken by a Nikon D200 camera using a single flashlight to the upper left at an elevation of approximately 60\u00b0, giving a high-contrast image with good rendering of surface relief.\nThis asymmetrical rendering, which depends on both illumination and viewing angles, makes it difficult to decide whether a coin was minted by the same die. In general, the intensity, direction, and number of light sources may vary from one studio to another, leading to differences in the shadows cast, the contrast between bright and dark regions, and the rendering of surface texture. Different lighting directions may make small patterns on the coin, such as inscriptions and symbols, look very different, and highlights arising from specularity of the metallic surface may affect the quality of the images, especially when automatic exposure correction is enabled in the camera. The use of polarizing filters to reduce specular highlights can cause undesirable birefringence effects [4]. More fundamentally, the projection of the 3D object surface onto the 2D image means that valuable information about the object is discarded, which makes it more difficult to analyse distortions arising from the striking of the coin in the die and also of subsequent wear and corrosion [5].\nBecause of the relatively small size, shallow relief, and metallic specularity of most coins, special techniques are needed for photography. In addition to a reproduction table with two light sources at changeable angles from the side and a DSLR camera with a good macro lens, careful attention needs to be paid to the geometry of the incident illumination. In general, the raised areas of the surface need to be rendered in the image by tones different from those of the ground plane of the coin. This cannot be achieved in most cases by a single light source at an oblique angle, as in Fig.\u00a01, because for a shiny surface the light is reflected away from the camera, making it appear too dark. Moreover, the reflection from the leading edge of each surface feature becomes an over-exposed specular highlight, while the trailing edge is cast into shadow. The resulting image is harsh in contrast and the gradients are strongly directional, and fine surface texture may be exaggerated.\nIn summary, to produce a good photography of a silver coin, mostly of shallow relief and often specular in appearance, careful attention needs to be paid to incident angle of the lighting. A setup with two lights can produce a good rendering and surface relief. Instructions for coin photography are described in Goodman [6] and Hoberman [7]. Digital photography with or without a reproduction table, or even the use of flatbed scanners for reproducible lighting,1 is used today to produce 2D digital images for searchable coin databases alongside textual information.\n\n\nDome photography for PTM/RTI visualisation\nThe re-lighting method PTM (Polynomial Texture Mapping) was first developed by Hewlett Packard Research Laboratories [8] and immediately identified as a potential tool for cultural heritage imaging. PTM is a special case of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), a family of computational photography techniques that capture a subject\u2019s surface shape and colour and enable the interactive re-lighting of the subject from any light direction seen from one top-down point of view (see Fig.\u00a03, demonstration or PTM/RTI software\u00a0in, Additional file 3: Film S3). RTI methods do not record the 3D surface directly but rather estimate the angular reflectance distribution at each point on the surface and hence create the illusion of 3D viewing of artefacts. Both technologies allow the application of imaging filters to enhance the viewing for researchers and visitors [9] as well as inspection of surface details and manufacture [10]. Recording in the dome enables reproducible lighting and therefore a controlled environment. This can potentially be used for the monitoring of colour and surface changes.\n\nFig.\u00a03\nCoin A, obverse (detail) of six different image dome captures (PTM/RTI) a RTI capture UCL dome; b RTI capture CyI dome; c RTI capture RBINS Minidome, albedo mode; d RTI capture RBINS Minidome, ambient mode; e RTI capture with dome at Southampton university; f for comparison of detail: a focus stacked picture (Aurore Mathys, RBINS)\n\nFor this study, six different imaging domes were used on the test coins. The comparison of these technologies was challenging due to the following variables: different equipment (dome, lens, camera, and lighting), different orientation of the coin, proprietary output formats, variety of software to create RTI and viewers. Visual comparison and statistical methods were used to assess colour realism, specularity, impression of the dimensions, sharpness of rendering and appearance of the surface topology [11].\n\n\nFocus stacking\nEven though coins are of shallow relief, the use of focus-stacking can significantly improve the detail and readability of the rather small coins at high magnification, as shown in an example for test coin A, see Fig.\u00a04.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nCoin A obverse and reverse, image obtained from focus stacking picture (Aurore Mathys, RBINS)\n\n\nThe low cost focus stacking setup used to produce this image was composed of a closet with two diffuse flashlights positioned under the object. Pictures were taken with a Canon EOS 600D DSLR placed on a Cognisys Stackshot, which was mounted vertically above the object. Several pictures at different focus distances were taken for each view to be processed afterwards in a stacker software in order to achieve an extended focus picture [12].\nFocus stacking can also be achieved through digital microscopy. The images are known of having a high standard deviation of set of pixels in the vicinity of the pixel in focus. The stacker software utilizes this rule and examines for every pixel of the image the whole stack of identically located pixels and selects the image of the highest deviation value and from this image it copies the examined pixel and its neighbours into the final image of enhanced focal depth [13].\nFocus-stacking may also be accomplished by a digital microscope with robotic stage. The illumination is an adjustable combination of axial and indirect (black field) light. The focus stacking and stitching are performed on part of the coin surface. Focus-stacking leads to high photographic detail for a 3D surface model and for remote inspection or inspection next to the coin, see Fig.\u00a05.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nCoin A obverse, digital microscopy (Jaroslav Valach, ITAM)\n\n\n\n\nPhotogrammetry and structure from motion (SfM)\nDigital close range photogrammetry, using a DSLR camera and lighting, is an established non-contact optical technique from remote sensing and is used for the documentation of objects by aerial photogrammetry at a variety of scales, amongst them museum artefacts and heritage buildings. Photogrammetry is capable of delivering high-resolution colour images ideal for the documentation of current condition and damages on the surface of the artefact, enabling the visualisation of details of the order of 50\u00a0\u03bcm. Structure from Motion (SfM) uses the principle that movement through a scene allows an understanding of the shape of the scene in three dimensions, in the same way as walking through a room allows one to visualise the space and objects placed within it. In SfM, this is represented by a series of systematic viewpoints; overlapping photographs are taken from multiple angles around the object, either by moving around the artefact, or by moving the object on a turntable in front of a camera on a tripod. The result will be of higher quality if there is no directional lighting that produces shadows, for example if photographs are taken with indirect lighting to the ceiling or using a light tent acting as a diffuser with lights. The digital output is a 3D coloured point cloud, i.e. a large number\u00a0of co-ordinate points in space, or a surface model, i.e. coloured polygon mesh of triangles, [14] and [15]. In summary, photogrammetry and SfM are applicable for objects of variable scale and surface properties [16] and therefore also applicable to the small Roman coins of this study.\nFor the surface inspection of coins this provides an interactive digital display where the coin can be magnified and turned around to inspect surface accretions as well as writing. Applied filters in software can enhance the viewing (see demonstration in Additional file 2: Film S2).\n\n\n3D laser and structured light scanning for 3D spatial capture\nFor small and medium size objects, 3D laser scanners and 3D structured light scanners are often used\u00a0for topometric data acquisition. Both systems are based on the triangulation principle. The coins pose two challenges to 3D scanning systems: surface resolution on a small and near-flat surface, and material specularity, i.e. shininess. The ideal object properties for the selected 3D scanner have features no smaller than its Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) or finest resolution (the distance to resolve the finest detail on the surface). If a scanner can record a resolution of 50\u00a0\u03bcm for example, the smallest recordable and identifiable feature on the dataset will not be smaller than 100\u00a0\u03bcm. A human with acute perception would expect to see more from a close up inspection with a hand-lens, than from a 3D scan at 100\u00a0\u03bcm sampling distance.\nFor both, photogrammetry and 3D scanning, the ideal object surface would also be a matte (i.e. diffusely reflecting) surface. For the surface recording of an object like the Roman coins the challenge of a specular or shiny surface needs to be overcome, due to the glare into the optics. A strategy to record from an angular position from object to sensor might help the recording process. The difference between the points recorded on the surface from a nadir (or top down) position versus an angular recording can be seen in Fig.\u00a06. Occlusions and transparencies can also be challenging for 3D scanners and photogrammetry, but these are not applicable here. Recording of the thin object from the side, as well as the alignment of back and front also poses a problem with coin-like objects.\n\nFig.\u00a06\nCoin A and B, obverse. 3D colour laser scan at 100\u00a0\u03bcm resolution, from 30\u00b0 angle (top) and nadir position (bottom) (Mona Hess, UCL)\n\n\nIn laser scanners employing the triangulation principle, the triangle is formed between the sensor with\u00a0(1) an emitter/laser line projection\u00a0with known angle of the emitted laser line\u00a0and (2) an offset\u00a0optical sensor with a known baseline, i.e. distance to the emitter and (3) the surface\u00a0point where the laser line hits the object. This setup allows the measurement of adjacent points in a specific depth of field of the triangle commensurate with the sensor specifications [14]. Detailed information about the 3D laser scanners used in this study can be found in Table\u00a01. Visual outcomes of the three different laser scanners used in this study can be seen in Figs.\u00a06, 7 and 8.Table\u00a01\nSummary of methods and technologies used for this study with expected outcomes\nMethodSensor/analytical tools usedExpected data outcomeConclusionsPhotographyDSLR (Nikon D200)Digital images\u00a0=\u00a0pixel-dataAppearance of the coin, text and image, corrosion, etc.Focus-stackingDSLR Canon EOS 600D\u00a0+\u00a0Cognisys StackshotDigital microscopy Hirox KH-7700Digital images\u00a0=\u00a0pixel-data, 3D surface geometrySurface image in high-resolution and high depth of field, imagery with high photographic detailDigital microscopyDigital microscopy Hirox KH-7700Same as aboveSame as aboveDome-photography/PTM/RTIDSLR camera in nadir position\u00a0+\u00a0lights (flash or LED lights) in a half-dome, four arrangements used in this researchRaw digital image data and colour calibrated images according to camera/lens/resolutionSurface visualisation with interactive lighting of near-flat objects, no 3D informationPhotometric stereoSame as above, (machine vision) camera and robotic light with rotation table in dark spaceSame as above\u00a0+\u00a0coloured surface geometry3D surface geometry for near-flat objects (in colour) at high detailPhotogrammetry and SfMDSLR\u00a0+\u00a0lightsRaw digital image data, colour calibrated images, 3D surface point cloud, 3D surface modelSurface geometry in 3D and surface colour3D scanning3D laser scanner (IDENTIK 300L Arius Technology Scanner, Micro-Epsilon, NextEngine), 3D structured light scanner (MechScan 3D Macro, SmartSCAN HE with 8MP stereo cameras) (complemented by analytical balance)Same as above; volume [cm3], plus in combination with the analytical balance weight: density [g/cm3]Surface geometry in 3D and surface colour; determination of volume, material composition estimation due to known material densitiesmicroCTMicrotomograph Nanotom 180 (GE Phoenix), measurement conditionsX-ray imagesInternal structure, rendered 3D model, film of slices (link to Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4)SEM/EDXSEM (JEOL JSM 7600F) coupled with EDXElemental spectra with characteristic peaks, tables of elemental % per sampling area, 3D Image of the surface, elemental analysis to 15\u00a0\u03bcm surface depthElemental analysis of coins, elemental matrix maps of surface, surface image with 3D visualisationXRFARTAX 200, ARTAX 800, S1 Titan handheld XRF spectrometer (Bruker)Elemental spectra with elemental analysis to 150\u00a0\u03bcm surface depthSurface chemistry of the coin, multi-elemental analysisGas pycnometryPycnometer Micrometrics AccuPyc II 1340 (complemented by analytical balance)Volume [cm3], plus in combination with the analytical balance weight: density [g/cm3]Determination of volume, material composition estimation due to known material densitiesAnalytical balanceKern, Sartorius B120SWeight [g]Same as above \n\nFig.\u00a07\n3D laser scan of, coin A and B with NextEngine HD (Vera\u00a0Moitinho de Almeida)\n \n\nFig.\u00a08\n3D close-range laser scanning with Micro-Epsilon (Jaroslav Valach, ITAM)\n\nA structured light scanner is an area-based imaging technique, consisting of a projector and at least one camera. Instead of projecting laser lines or spots, it projects patterns of a structured\u00a0light sequence\u00a0(called Gray Code or Phase Shift sequence)\u00a0for topometric data acquisition. The calculation of 3D data is based on the triangulation principle; typical triangulation angles are at\u00a0approximately 30\u00b0. The camera is mounted in a calibrated position relative to the projector, and thus defines the base line of emitting system and measurement sensor. The scanning system projects light patterns onto the object surface. The contrast of the light patterns influences the quality of scan results (Fig.\u00a09, [17]).\n\nFig.\u00a09\n3D structured light scan of Coin B, reverse and obverse. Colour information mapped from an external camera (Dirk Rieke-Zapp, Aicon 3D Systems)\n\nAn advantage of many close-range 3D systems is that the kit can easily be transported to the site or museum. Some are also flexible: various fields of views can be recorded with a single sensor through changing elements, either camera lenses or by varying the baseline, i.e. the distance between the projector(s) and camera. A further advantage is the speed of recording for one 3D record, the projection of all patterns lasts only a few seconds. While structured light sensors are limited by pixel count, data density and range resolution, they usually deliver sub-millimetre sampling of the surface [18], some even capable of reaching resolutions in the order of 20\u00a0\u00b5m (XY) and 3\u00a0\u00b5m (Z).\nSee Fig.\u00a07 for a 3D image by structured light of Coin B, where colour information could be\u00a0mapped from an\u00a0sensor-internal calibrated camera or external camera using add-on software.\n\n\nPhotometric stereo\nThe 3D surface geometry, defined by the array of surface normal vectors, may be deduced from radiometric measurement of reflected light if the illumination geometry is known. This method enables the documentation of topography and visual appearance at the same time.\nFor this study, two setups were used:\nIn the first setup two representations, PTM dome images and 3D colour laser scanning were combined to produce a digital elevation map of each coin with the accuracy of the scanner and the fine detail of the photography. The result was a realistic rendering of the coins at a spatial resolution of 75 pixels/mm (13\u00a0\u03bcm), in which the fine detail modulated the underlying geometric form of the surface relief. Results are shown in Figs.\u00a010 and 11 (a detailed description of the method is available in [11].)\n\nFig.\u00a010\nCoin A. obverse, photometric stereo from dome-photography. Final reconstruction of Diva Favstina (Lindsay W.\u00a0MacDonald, UCL)\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a011\nSurface normals from photometric image sets (Lindsay W.\u00a0MacDonald, UCL)\n\n\nSecondly, a setup with a fixed machine-vision camera and illumination and a robotic arm to move the object in a light-controlled dark space. The resulting resolution is about 50\u00a0\u03bcm (see Fig.\u00a012).\n\nFig.\u00a012\nCoin A, obverse. Photometric Stereo from machine vision camera and light, object on robotic arm (Jaroslav Valach, ITAM)\n\n\nBoth methods produce very high-resolution surface 3D point clouds and allow surface measurement from the computed profile. These representations are very similar to the inspection of a coin with a magnification lens, but can be presented on a larger screen (see demonstration of 3D surface model in, Additional file 1: Film S1).\n\n\nQuantitative geometric comparison of 3D surface models\nRigorous procedures are important for the documentation, characterization, and understanding of each individual 3D model of a coin. A quantitative topological and geometrical comparison of 3D surface models was carried out using the following indicators: 3D vertices/triangles, maximum diameter, shape factor, surface area, volume, along with measured weight and density of the coins (C, D). Furthermore, comparisons between the 3D models were undertaken looking at the convergence and RMS error of the alignment, and deviation values (standard, mean, upper and lower deviation). Figure\u00a013 shows pairwise differences between complete 3D models of coin A: colour difference map, distribution of differences, and standard deviation. It was found that multiple factors\u2014such as sensor limitations, used methods and techniques to acquire, process and analyse 3D data\u2014influenced the numerical outcomes and therefore the confidence for the characterisation and study of the coins. Notwithstanding, the imaging technologies proved to be a valuable tool for the documentation, study and dissemination, as well as for the improvement and automation of the analysis of coins [3].\n\nFig.\u00a013\nPairwise differences between complete 3D models of coin A: colour difference map, distribution of differences, and std. deviation\n(Vera\u00a0Moitinho de Almeida 2016\u2014Reference\u00a0[3])\n\n\n\n\nPhysico-chemical analysis of coins\nThe use of physico-chemical analyses is applicable to the study of coins, amongst others to assist in material composition. For this study, a series of surface sensitive analytical methods have been used, and as the coins are portable, they could be brought to participating institutions.\n\nX-ray computed microtomography\nX-ray microtomography method (also called X-ray microCT) is an imaging method allowing the 3D reconstruction of an opaque object by illuminating it with X-rays in different directions by transforming a directionally dense set of object\u2019s x-ray radiograms into complete 3D model [19]. It can be used for the visualisation of internal microstructure of 3D objects. This method helped identify cracks and impurities through the coins and voids inside the coins, and allowed visualisation of defects and corrosion effects. Results show a heterogeneous X-ray absorption in different parts of the coin, and this could be due to possible enrichment of elements and wear on the surface, or molten metal which\u00a0had a heterogeneous distribution of elements. Figure\u00a014 shows three perpendicular microCT sections and the rendered 3D model visualises a crack inside the Roman coin A. The 186 resulting images of horizontal slices through the coin can also be viewed as a film sequence (see a demonstration in Additional file 4: Film S4).\n\nFig.\u00a014\nX-ray computed microtomography of Coin A (Miroslav Hain, SAV)\n\n\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)/EMPA (Electron Microprobe Analysis)\nIn Scanning Electron Microscopy, the electron beam gradually passes in rows across the area under investigation, and at each point on these rows it causes physical interactions with the surface whose intensity is recorded by the probe, and converted to the grey scale of the image being formed. In this way, images with magnification, depth of field, and information that cannot be reached by light microscopy, can be obtained. The energy of the incident electrons is sufficient to trigger X-ray fluorescence\u2014excite the electrons in the surface atoms, and they emit their characteristic spectrum upon return to the basic state. By analysing the spectra, it is possible to determine the species of atoms composing the surface, but also their relative weight proportions. Composition of surface can be studied in individual points or in the whole area forming \u201ccomposition maps\u201d, see Fig.\u00a019. It therefore offers simultaneous morphological and compositional surface analysis, as well as\u00a0visualisation of a surface to a depth of typically 1\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm. Material samples often are cut, embedded in resin, and polished for the sampling, but this was of course not performed on the ancient Roman coins and is avoided when examining artefacts. Whilst SEM yields surface specific local information of spectra, it does not give an overall value of the material at the inside of the coin due. If homogeneity is assumed it needs to be stated, and the results are of course not transferable to the material composition inside a coin when measuring plated coins. SEM also has limitations to yield results about the underlying material if corrosion or other dirt covers the surfaces.\nEDX or EDS (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) is an analytical method used for elemental analysis of a sample under test, in this case silver coins. Usually, the EDX device is part of the SEM (scanning electron microscope). In this study, EDX was used for the elemental analysis of coins, determination of silver content and trace metals, for addressing the issue of authenticity of the coins. The method is known for its sensitivity to surface treatment of examined object and the reliability of composition quantification decreases with a presence of light elements. For precise determination of surface composition WDS (wave dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) should be used [20]. Examples for the measurements on coins are shown in Figs.\u00a015 and 16.\n\nFig.\u00a015\nEDX elemental analysis of Coin A (Miroslav Hain, SAV)\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a016\nEDX elemental analysis of Coin B (Miroslav Hain, SAV)\n\n\nAtomic composition was determined at six rectangular areas for both coin A and coin B. Because of high spatial resolution, differences in results can be attributed not only to measurement error, but also to true local variations of composition of the coins. The average values (96.9% of silver for coin A and 92.56% for coin B) can only cautiously be used to deduce the silver content in the whole volume of coins. Standard deviations indicate variability of results\u20140.603 for coin A and 1.879 for coin B).\nEDS analysis was performed also on another SEM to assess a difference in results. The analysis can be carried out point-wise as is shown in Fig.\u00a015, the above mentioned spatial variation of composition is best illustrated by Fig.\u00a019 showing concentration maps for selected elements. Figure\u00a017 is presenting the composition measurement at three different spots of coin B\u00a0(SEM of Coin B); it indicates differences between results produced by different devices when compared to Fig.\u00a016.\n\nFig.\u00a017\nSEM sampling results for elemental analysis on three spots, SEM surface image of coin A obverse, detail Favstinas\u2019 ear (Veronika Koudelkov\u00e1, ITAM)\n\nEMPA for coin A is illustrated in Figs.\u00a018 and 19. It should be noted that some places on coin are dirty and the fact can alter the analysis, as the electron beam penetrates few microns of material.\n\nFig.\u00a018\nClose-up SEM surface image of coin B obverse on the ear of Favstina. Yellow numbers indicate sampling spots for elemental analysis (Veronika Koudelkov\u00e1, ITAM)\n \n\nFig.\u00a019\nSpectra from EPMA of coin B. Measurement spots indicated in Fig.\u00a018 (Veronika Koudelkov\u00e1, ITAM)\n\n\n\nMicro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry mapping\nThis case study also explored the use of the non-destructive analytical technique, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, which has become a favoured analytical method in numismatics. The XRF method differs from SEM/EDX by providing depth information up to 150\u00a0\u03bcm. A very accurate 3D representation of a coin may be combined with chemical maps resulting from XRF measurements. Previous research on this topic was undertaken by Del Hoyo-Mel\u00e9ndez with relevance to elemental surface analysis of medieval coins by XRF [21]. The method shows potential for providing insights into the provenance of the raw material and manufacturing processes. The results can also be mapped to the surface to visualise the concentrations of specific elements.\nFor this project, three different XRF spectrometers, one of them portable, were used to compare the results of the elemental composition of the surface. With each of the three instruments, multiple measurements were taken from distinct spots and averaged to obtain an uncertainty value of the measurement. Whilst a detailed description of the thorough and scientific measurement method has been provided by the expert, it will not be presented here. It can be summarized that chemical composition of coins was determined by three different methods\u2014handheld X-ray fluorescence (S1-Titan, 5\u00a0mm analysis spot), micro X-ray fluorescence (ARTAX 200, qualitative and quantitative data, chemical compositions maps) and by energy dispersive spectroscopy in SEM, respectively. Due to the different nature of the devices including standard deviation values and the positioning of the coins (ARTAX on a horizontal position with a support, and the handheld devices measuring surface contacting the coin) certainly identical measuring points could not\u00a0be investigated and the investigated areas differ. To concentrate on the silver content, the methods yielded coin A 93.0% (relative error For Ag\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0, S1-Titan), 96.0% (\u00b1\u00a00.75, ARTAX 200) and 96.9% (SEM/EDX) respectively, and the silver content of the coin B 95.1% (relative error for Ag\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0, S1-Titan), 97.9% (\u00b1\u00a00.75, ARTAX 200) and 92.5% (SEM/EDX) respectively. Although the penetration of the SEM/EDX device is lower (80\u00a0\u03bcm) with respect to XRF (150\u00a0\u03bcm), it can be observed that the results are generally in agreement. However, it is worth noticing that the Ag concentration for coin B is lower in the SEM/EDX analysis as an outlier. The copper content was estimated to ca 4% and the other elements are mostly dirt from handling - carbon and oxides based compounds. The results show that multi-elemental analysis can be obtained, which for this project help complement other measurement methods\u00a0(more information in [3] and\u00a0[22]).\n\n\nGas pycnometry\nThe weighting of the coins was undertaken using pycnometry, which is a non-destructive and non-invasive method during which the coins are only exposed to helium gas in a vacuum. This allowed a determination of the coin density for an estimation of the alloy composition. The results allow the calculation of the compositions if an assumption is taken that the binary alloy is valid. The method works best when the tested specimens fills the measured cavity, when coins are flat and of low volume. The interesting outcome of the measurement of the coin density was that because of the flatness of the coin, the physical method was stretched to its limit and did not reach optimal precision in determining the\u00a0actual volume of the coin as well as estimation of its composition. Therefore, in this particular case the optical methods for digitizing the coin and calculating its volume delivered better results.\n\n\nSummary of methods and technologies used for this study\nTable\u00a01 provides a summary of methods and technologies used for this study. A further detailed overview of the technologies can be consulted in book chapter [3]\u00a0and\u00a0[22].\n\nDiscussion of resultsThe aim of this study was to demonstrate a multi-modal and interdisciplinary approach to analysing and interpreting coins beyond the applications currently used in museums and numismatic collections. A number of technologies were applied to examine two selected Roman Coins to glean more information about their authenticity, materials, manufacture, and iconography. Through consultation with expert numismatists, typical tasks in numismatic collections were\u00a0summarised above in \u201cBackground\u201d. These tasks were then\u00a0addressed by a combination of optical imaging and other analytical methods, such as physico-chemical. Tasks towards the physical conservation of the coins (Tasks a, g, h) are supported by optical imaging (Tasks b, c, d, f, g, i), with additional evidence by physico-chemical analyses (Tasks c\u2014corrosion products, e, f, g, i). A combination of different optical and other analytical methods from conservation science has been found useful to obtain a holistic information\u00a0of the surface properties, geometry, and colour as well as material properties and internal structure of the two exemplary Roman Coins.Discussion of optical imaging methods used in this case study\u00a0The use of optical imaging methods has produced the following conclusions, which are transferable to research on small cultural heritage artefacts in general:\nOptical recording technologies in 2D and 3D have matured in the last years, but research and development in hardware and software is still ongoing [23, 24]. Particularly, there is a challenge for standardization of recording decision-making processes for the recording and documentation of digital data. The London Charter has provided some first proposals [25, 26]. Further challenges are policies and strategies for long-term digital preservation, as well as for transparency and access to digital data [27, 28]. All digital data and corresponding metadata (data information that provides information about other data) and paradata (information on how the capture did take place: for example type and model of machine, calibration, parameters, place and time, environmental conditions, operator decisions during recording and processing) produced were shared during this case study and have been saved in a specific repository and are made available on a project website.\n\nDepending on the characteristics of the object, the scale of observation and the type of information required, the accuracy, resolution and precision of the measurements should be selected high enough to fulfil the numismatist\u2019s or experts\u2019 needs for scientific documentation and study.\n\nA comparative and critical assessment of existing methodologies for PTM/RTI dome acquisition for the high-resolution visualisation of the coin surfaces showed that currently the quality of the results is dependent on the capabilities of the operator in combination with hardware and software parameters. Furthermore, there are currently no standards for the paradata or metadata to describe this process [3].\n\nPhotometric stereo produces a highly resolved surface. Despite the fact that the 3D surface models from 3D scans and SfM did not reach the highest quality of the 3D data acquired by structured light scanners, the photometric imaging should be considered as an additional and alternative method for producing 3D models for dissemination purposes [11].\n\nA methodological framework (Fig.\u00a02) has been proposed for the 3D digital data acquisition, process and analysis of historical coins [3]. It has taken into account the order and type of other methods used, as well as the topological and geometrical characterisation and comparison of 3D models, with the particular example of coins. The workflow starts with the research question centred on a cultural heritage object, which influences the next steps of planning, data collection, data analysis, and interpretation of results, which then feed back into answering the original research question. Data collection is at the heart of this workflow and is informed by the results of using non-invasive and invasive technologies, which again is governed by an agreed 3D data strategy noting all parameters of environment, hardware, software, technicians and the cultural heritage object itself. The importance lies in the recording of all metadata and paradata about the process towards a scientific and technical documentation. This proposed framework could be transferred to other types of objects. Further details of data collection of this project are listed in detail in another publication [3].\n\nTechnologies used to produce 3D digital datasets applied here on Roman coins allow non-destructive, non-invasive recording of the surface to construct a virtual image of the real object that can be navigated and explored on the display of a computer or even mobile device and in Virtual Reality. With developments in 3D scanning technologies over the past 10\u00a0years, it is now feasible to digitize the objects of heritage institutions and to create 3D archives, thereby enabling visualization of each object \u2018in the round\u2019. Nevertheless, many practical issues remain concerning the precision of the system, accuracy, and resolution of the datasets, speed of acquisition and time required for post-processing.\n\nConsultation with cultural heritage professionals has confirmed the relevance of 3D imaging and established that, by creating accurate geometric representations, user motivations can be addressed for surface measurement and inspection, deformation monitoring, and 3D printing with particular benefits for conservation and research, [29, 30].\nDiscussion of\u00a0Physico-chemical analytical methods\u00a0used in this case study A crosscheck between all results of SEM/EDX and XRF shows similar results of chemical characterization, with difference of the depth of material penetration of each method. In the case of the Roman coins, curators have some interest in the composition, especially percentage silver (%Ag). In this study, upon hearing the similarity of results across different physico-chemical measurements named above, numismatists were dubious about our measurements of 97% silver (Ag) in Favstina coins, which post-date Nero\u2019s debasement. One expert summarised that the production of silver coins was as refined as possible during Nero\u2019s reign until 70 AD with a high %Ag, after which it dropped to below 90% Ag, and from 190 AD onwards dropped dramatically to ca 50% Ag.2 On this basis, the authenticity of the coins, which are believed to be a posthumous deification issue from 141AD, should be re-examined.Discussion of interdisciplinary approach and framework used in this study\u00a0This project featured an interdisciplinary approach in consultation with numismatic experts. The project team was formed of twelve specialists, some with expertise in two or more disciplines, including: archaeology, art history and museology, conservation and heritage science, chemistry and electrochemistry, mechatronics and engineering, metrology, computer science, computer graphics and data processing. This joint panel of experts produced holistic knowledge about two ancient Roman coins, with a great expenditure of time and care with the aim to produce active guidelines for end users in numismatic collections [31]. Discussion and feedback was sought in a team discussion with four numismatic experts. All methods used in this case study were presented and discussed to check that they met requirements in real world numismatic collections [3].A costing of the time and budget used for this study and a technical report was delivered by each collaborator to the case study leader. The following elements are relevant to costing a project such as this: cost and running time of the hardware and software licenses as well as highly skilled and experienced operator time including time spent on preparation, data acquisition, data processing, reporting and data presentation, as well as data archiving. In some instances, development time for prototype software and hardware should be taken into account. As this was an EU network project with experimental character, all collaborators in this project gave their time and the use of the technical equipment for free, only indicative costs could be collected.When presented to the numismatic experts, not all methods and technologies employed were perceived affordable in terms of time and cost for numismatic collections, but nevertheless results could be applicable in single cases. The meeting inspired visions for new workflows and future virtual numismatic presentation.\nReview of ongoing research for automated coin classificationAdditionally to the methods used in this study on only two coins, 2D images and 3D images of coin collections can both be used to classify coins. This following section will give a brief insight of ongoing research for the automation of coin classification, interpretation, and metadata extraction for databases.Methods from automated coin image analysis in computer vision have been used for automated image recognition, based on feature extraction and segmentation of 2000 coins was presented in 2007 [32] and to an automation coin attribution system using image analysis by locally biased directional histograms in 2010 [19]. Zambanini used 3D structured light scanning on a set of 25 coins, to produce metric three-dimensional surface models in colour and geometry, which can overcome limitations of 2D image recording with regards to specularity of the metal surface [33]. Zambanini and Kampel further proposed a classifier-free procedure for automated coin classification based on 2D image matching based on the SIFT operator (scale-invariant feature transform) in 2011, [34] and [35]. Huber-Moerk described the automated classification and identification of modern and ancient coins based on the analysis of 2D shapes and 3D shapes on a set of 12,000 coins [36]. Kavelar et al. review existing methods for coin classification in detail, including OCR text recognition, and propose coin classification through extraction of legends of Roman Republican Coins by the SIFT descriptor in 2014 [37]. In 2012, Arandjelovi\u0107 proposes a method to automatically extract information from coins from a single photograph by recognising a denarius, extracting the legends and producing a metadata set to enable laymen to report finds to authorities, here to the \u2018UK portable antiquities scheme\u2019 [38]. In 2014, Kim and Pavlovic propose a method directly handles the spatial location of the visual feature to encode the image from existing image-based data [39]. Anwar et al. describe a method for Ancient Coin Classification Using Reverse Motif Recognition for image-based classification of Roman Republican coins\u00a0in 2015 [40].Ongoing research should be observed by the interested stakeholders in numismatics.\nConclusionThe project has produced a comprehensive study using a multi-modal approach using a wide range of methods and technologies used for studying ancient coins on the example of two Roman coins. Optical imaging technologies are mostly well-established applications and show a range of results regarding resolution, accuracy, and precision. 3D digital models may enable the extraction of additional features for object characterization which are not available in 2D (e.g. deviation on the coin\u2019s surface morphology, 3D surface area and volume measurements, cross-sections), to their quantitative characterization and analysis. Although a 3D digital model does not provide a complete picture of the object, it should be understood as a powerful tool\u2014potentially, with valid data\u2014for visualisation and cultural heritage research, and complementary to other measurement methods [29]. Overall, the analytical methods used in this case study contributed to a holistic knowledge of the coins at different scales and with different types of information.Whilst the wide adoption of all scientific methods mentioned in this study might be beyond the financial means of many numismatic collections, this project should offer guidance to those researchers who may find it useful to select specific technologies for their own research on coins. The results indicate the feasibility of such methods for museum documentation and as contribution to scientific examination of coins in general. The target beneficiaries of these applications would be numismatic researchers and scientists, historians, collectors, conservators and educators.In a time where user interfaces become more accessible, software becomes increasingly open-source, and recording technologies more affordable, the outlook for the future is the integration of the workflows towards an automated acquisition and analysis of numismatic collections to make them more accessible for education and\u00a0research via digital repositories.\nFootnotes1Personal Communication from the COSCH Roman Case study meeting on 22 June 2016 at University College London.

The tradition of mummification persisted for thousands of years, using processes and materials which changed geographically and through time. Much is now known of both the mummification process and the mummies themselves, partly due to the application of modern imaging techniques, often derived from medical imaging [1]. Our interest here, however, is in the cartonnage cases, panels and masks used to cover the mummified and wrapped body. Cartonnage is a composite material made up of layers of various materials, such as linen and papyrus which were covered with plaster that was often brightly painted [2]. By the Ptolemaic Period (323-30BCE), it was becoming common to make cartonnage from old inscribed papyrus sheet and rolls that were frequently cut and moulded to support the painted plaster. The manufacturing process used sections of papyrus in such a way that they are relatively well preserved and now form a rich source of manuscripts from this period.The discovery that mummy cartonnage could contain writing dates back to the earliest years of papyrology and Egyptology. The first person to have retrieved papyri from mummy cartonnage seems to have been the French archaeologist Jean Antoine Letronne c1825CE who was disappointed by their poor state of preservation and administrative contents [3]. In the early twentieth century, British papyrologists Grenfell and Hunt also realized that mummy cartonnage could contain recycled material and discovered, by chance, that discarded papyri had been used as part of the wrappings of crocodile mummies [4].Accessing the textual content of these recycled papyrus sheets and rolls is challenging and, although methods have improved in recent years, there is a consensus that all have been invasive to some extent [5]. Indeed, a number of controversial techniques have been used. Private owners of cartonnage of uncertain provenance have dissolved mummy masks and other cartonnage in water and soap to access papyri. The circulation of online videos, where these achievements were publicised without any respect for the many issues connected with this practice, has been condemned by the scientific community [6\u201310]. This phenomenon raises many concerns not only for the destructive methods employed, but also for the message it conveys to private owners and dealers, who may be attracted to destroy cultural heritage objects for their own aims. The dismounting of cartonnage causes the loss of material cultural evidence, even when performed through appropriate techniques and fully documented.Our contribution to this debate is to investigate the potential for modern non-destructive imaging techniques to identify, characterise and potentially enable the writing on papyrus which is beneath the surface of the object and invisible to the naked eye to be read. This research will inform the debate, publicise the damage caused by destructive techniques, assist conservators, and ultimately avoid the need for destructive analysis of these objects.To image writing in cartonnage successfully, an imaging technique needs to penetrate multiple layers of papyrus which may have been secured using adhesives, covered with plaster and contain air gaps. The technique must then detect paints in the form of dyes (which dissolve in water, are usually organic and adhere to the substrate) and pigments (which retain their particulate form and may be insoluble in water, but require a binder for surface adhesion), both of which may change characteristics over time [11]. Imaging techniques were selected that were expected to give contrast to either organic or inorganic pigments underneath layers of papyrus. Eight different imaging approaches were used, taken from optical imaging, X-ray imaging and terahertz imaging.The assessment of this wide range of imaging modalities presented here begins by using surrogate papyrus \u201cphantoms\u201d which provide a test platform that is more controlled and well characterised than original cartonnage. The use of well controlled test samples to characterise a system is standard practice in chemistry and the analytical sciences, and the use of digital and physical test phantoms for image characterisation is widespread in medical imaging [12, 13]. While both have been used in heritage science [14, 15], the method is not widespread, perhaps because of the approach that all heritage objects should be seen as individual and unique. However, the same is true of patients in medical imaging. The purpose of a phantom is not to reproduce all aspects of the object being examined, but to provide a simplified, reproducible and well understood object of low value whose characteristics are known and so can be used to compare and validate results objectively and safely. In this case, a simplified test object also allows the fundamental characteristics which are common to all cartonnage of interest\u2014papyrus and ink\u2014to be extracted from the complexities of adhesives, plaster, paint, and changes which occur over time, thereby allowing contributions from different variables to be assessed individually. Moreover, modern phantoms can be imaged and handled repeatedly without risk of damage, and can be shipped internationally without needing to deal with import restrictions. Such restrictions on shipping ancient artefacts, especially those closely associated with human remains, are complex, vary between jurisdictions and change over time. These advantages of using phantoms, it transpired, were critical to the success of the project.\nMethods\nDesign and construction of test phantoms\nThe phantoms were designed to isolate the challenges of imaging inks within papyrus by reproducing important features but avoiding the additional complexities of plaster, overlapping layers of text, damage, and other confounding factors. This allowed the characteristics of different imaging techniques to be determined under ideal conditions. Although these ideal conditions may never arise in historical artefacts, phantoms can inform the interpretation and selection of different imaging modalities.\nFour phantoms were constructed (Fig.\u00a01), each made from four 10\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0cm sheets of modern papyrus. The sheets were handmade using traditional methods without modern binders or adhesives and had two layers of papyrus pith per sheet (\u201cgenuine papyrus\u201d from greatart.co.uk). Each sheet was marked with a cross on one of four quadrants: the four crosses being under zero, one, two and three sheets of papyrus, respectively. A different ink was used to prepare each phantom. Three were selected to be representative of those used historically (carbon ink1 and red iron oxide2 ink being most common, and to a lesser extent, iron gall ink3) and one a modern carbon-based India ink (Winsor and Newton, UK) to provide a well-characterised, reproducible control sample. The inks were applied using a modern ink pen, as a traditional reed pen was found to give lines of inconsistent thickness. The ink mainly lay on the surface of each sheet, with minimal noticeable penetration into the papyrus.\n\nFig.\u00a01\nPhotographs of the four phantoms. From left, crosses in: iron gall ink; carbon ink; red iron oxide and India ink. A ruler is shown for scale\n\n\nTo avoid confounding factors arising from the use of adhesive, the papyrus sheets were not glued together but stitched into a flat composite. A single sheet was measured to be 0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0mm thick, and the composite phantoms all had similar thicknesses of 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1, 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1, 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 and 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mm for the phantoms with iron gall, carbon, red iron oxide and Indian ink, respectively. This suggests that, even though the phantoms were not glued, any air gap existing between the sheets was very small.\nThe phantoms were stored in resin frames to protect them and keep them flat, but were removed from the frames before being imaged using a range of modalities, as described below.\n\nMultispectral imaging\nMultispectral imaging is an extension of standard digital photography whereby an object is illuminated sequentially under different wavelengths from ultraviolet to near infrared and photographed [15\u201317]. Blue and ultraviolet light may excite fluorescence of inks or substrates, so filters are used to exclude the illumination light, enhancing the fluorescent signal. The multispectral imaging system used at UCL (R B Toth Associates, USA) is based around a PhaseOne IQ260 60\u00a0megapixel, 16 bit achromatic digital camera back and iXR body, and a 120\u00a0mm Schneider f/4 achromatic macro lens. Two lighting panels (Equipoise Imaging LLC, USA) contain LEDs which emit light at 12 wavelengths from 370 to 940\u00a0nm, and long pass filters can be used to image fluorescence by excluding the illuminating light from capture by the camera. Light in this wavelength range is widely used in heritage applications as it can be detected with a silicon sensor, allowing high resolution imaging with consumer devices. The system is controlled using Spectral XV software (Equipoise Imaging LLC, USA).\nPhantoms were imaged using 12 wavelengths without filters, and four with filters applied. \u201cFlat field\u201d images were also acquired of a sheet of uniform white photographic print paper to characterise the uniformity of illumination and distortions within the camera such as vignetting. All images were divided by the flat fields prior to subsequent analysis. Analysis involved examination of an image at a single wavelength, taking the ratio of images at different wavelengths, and more sophisticated methods like principal component analysis (PCA: a linear transformation of the images which provides a new set of images which often emphasise differences between the original images) [18].\n\nTransillumination\nTransillumination is a specific type of multispectral imaging. In the previous application of multispectral imaging described above, the illumination and detection occur on the same side of the object, in what may be referred to as a \u201creflection\u201d mode. The effective depth of penetration is therefore limited because even if light does penetrate deep into the object, once it returns to the surface to be detected, it tends to be overwhelmed by the accumulated reflections from all shallower regions traversed by the light.\nTransillumination or backlighting helps to mitigate against this by illuminating from the reverse of the object and detecting only light which has passed through it. This approach is commonly used in conjunction with multispectral imaging when analysing documents, and has had particular success when examining watermarks [19]. A bespoke illuminator containing an array of 28 white LEDs (LUMEX SLX-LX5093UWC/C, Farnell, UK) was used with the PhaseOne camera system described above. Filters were used to allow some limited assessment of wavelength dependence.\n\nOptical coherence tomography\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a photonic imaging technique predominantly used in ophthalmology [20]. It compares near infrared light that has scattered back from different depths in a sample to a reference signal in an interferometric approach which can provide micrometre resolution to a depth of approximately 1\u20132\u00a0mm in tissue. It is becoming increasingly common in heritage applications [21], particularly when looking for underdrawings [22, 23].\nTwo spectral domain OCT systems were used in this work: an Envisu R2200 system (Bioptigen, USA) at Duke University Eye Centre with a central wavelength of 840 nm and a Telestro system (Thorlabs, USA) at UCL, centred at 1300\u00a0nm.\n\nX-ray micro computed tomography\nX-ray micro computed tomography (XMT) provides high resolution images of the spatial distribution of X-ray attenuation within a medium. The phantoms were imaged using a high-contrast time-delay integration XMT system developed in-house and based around a chassis and source supplied by X-Tek (now Nikon Metrology, UK) at Queen Mary University of London. An X-ray tube potential of 40\u00a0kVp was used with a tungsten target and a 0.5\u00a0mm aluminium filter with a 5\u00a0\u03bcm focal spot size. The detector is a 16 megapixel CCD camera (Spectral Instruments, USA) coupled with fibre optics to a CsI scintillator (Applied Scintillation Technologies, UK). Previously, the system has been used to image heritage objects such as burnt parchment manuscript rolls [24] and historical film footage [25].\nThe phantoms were separated by plastazote LD-45 foam sheets and gently curved in a plastic holder. This approach allowed all four phantoms to be imaged simultaneously. In this set-up, the source and detector remain fixed and the sample rotates.\n\nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging\nWhen X-rays interact with a medium, X-rays may be emitted at a lower energy characteristic of the elemental composition of the object: a process known as X-ray fluorescence (XRF). This approach has commonly been used for analysing the composition of heritage objects [26\u201328]. Two different systems for measuring X-ray fluorescence were used: (1) synchrotron rapid scanning (SRS) XRF imaging using a monochromatic incident X-ray energy of 13.5\u00a0keV at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL, Stanford University, USA); and (2) handheld portable pXRF using an Olympus Delta Premium XRF analyser which emits at energies up to 40\u00a0keV. The former was operated in a high-resolution scanning mode and the latter gave spot measurements.\nThe pXRF system was held in a clamp stand over the phantom which sat on a 30\u00a0cm box of expanded polystyrene. This ensured that the system was sufficiently far from any background material that the signal could be assumed to result from the papyrus phantom itself.\n\nX-ray phase contrast imaging\nConventional X-ray techniques are sensitive to the X-ray attenuation of a medium, but materials such as papyrus have low attenuation, so contrast is low. Phase contrast X-ray generates images of the refraction of X-rays as they pass through a medium and therefore offers an alternative contrast mechanism. These methods usually require monochromatic, collimated beams from synchrotrons and have been used for cultural heritage, most famously for imaging the Herculaneum papyri scrolls [29, 30]. However, a laboratory-based edge-illumination X-ray phase contrast system at UCL operating at 25\u00a0mA current and 40 kVp voltage was used in this application [31]. Although a lab-based system is more suitable for delicate heritage artefacts, it should be noted that this system had been built for research into medical imaging applications and improved performance would be expected from a system optimised specifically for imaging cartonnage. The field of view is\u00a0~\u00a02\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0cm and multiple images, showing parameters such as X-ray absorption, refraction and scatter width are obtained [32, 33].\n\nTerahertz imaging and spectroscopy\nTerahertz frequencies (0.1\u201310\u00a0THz, or equivalently, wavelengths of 0.03\u20133\u00a0mm) lie between infrared and microwave radiation. The photon energy at 1 THz is very low, 4.14\u00a0meV, meaning that terahertz radiation is non-ionising. This radiation mainly interacts with the intermolecular chemical bonds, so provides image contrast depending on the chemical composition of the materials present. This technique is beginning to be applied in heritage science [34, 35]. The phantoms were imaged with a TeraPulse4000 system (Teraview Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at the University of Western Australia. The pulses of THz are generated in this system by the excitation of a low temperature grown GaAs wafer with a gold deposited bow-tie antenna with a 780\u00a0nm near infrared laser with a pulse width\u00a0~\u00a0100\u00a0fs. The image is formed by raster scanning the beam across the sample in x and y directions. This is a time-domain imaging system, in which each pixel contains the reflected THz pulse signal (amplitude and phase). Thus a three dimensional dataset (x,y,t) is obtained where the third dimension is time which, if the structure and refractive index of the sample are known, can be converted into depth. A reference measurement is acquired from an optically flat metallic mirror, and is deconvolved from the sample pulse prior to further analysis of the signal.\n\nResults\nPerformance of test phantoms\nThe test phantoms, mounted either in resin frames or within the pages of a book for protection during transport, were successfully imaged using multiple modalities in laboratories across three continents. Despite repeated handling, transport and imaging sessions, images of the phantoms taken at UCL at the start and end of the project (Nov 2015\u2013Mar 2017) were indistinguishable by eye from each other, suggesting that the properties of the phantoms had not changed substantially during the 18\u00a0months or so of the study. In more detailed analysis, the mean difference in the measured intensity across all pixels in images acquired on the same day (in an area selected to avoid edges, thread or ink) was\u00a0~\u00a00.3%. This was taken to be an estimate of the test\u2013retest reproducibility of the system. Multispectral images of the four phantoms were acquired at the beginning and end of the project, 18\u00a0months apart. They were aligned by registration using the Mattes mutual information algorithm [Matlab 2016a (The Mathworks, USA)] and had a mean difference (after registration, and after the lights had been repositioned), of 4.2% (iron gall), 1.1% (carbon ink), 1.0% (red iron oxide ink) and 0.8% (India ink). Differences of\u00a0~\u00a01% were assumed to be due to errors in registration and different lighting conditions. The higher difference occurred to the phantom with crosses in iron gall ink and suggests that there may have been some damage to that phantom during transit or handling.\n\nMultispectral imaging\nFor all phantoms, the greatest penetration was seen with the longest wavelength, 940\u00a0nm (shown in Fig.\u00a02). Images processed with PCA (Fig.\u00a03) were unable to demonstrate improved penetration. Similarly, other approaches such as image subtraction were unsuccessful.\n\nFig.\u00a02\nMultispectral images of all four phantoms (with from left, crosses in: iron gall ink; carbon ink; red iron oxide and India ink) at 940\u00a0nm, normalized, showing penetration down to the third layer\n\n\n\nFig.\u00a03\nPseudocolour renderings of (from left) phantoms with crosses in: iron gall ink; carbon ink; red iron oxide and India ink following principal component analysis. The analysis was intended to maximise contrast of the deepest crosses\n\n\nUnfortunately, measurements of contrast or signal-to-noise ratio were unsatisfactory, as the eye\u2013brain system is guided by the shape of the cross. On a purely quantitative measurement of signal-to-noise ratio, even the second cross, which is clear on visual examination, has a signal which is less than two standard deviations above variations in the background.\nMultispectral imaging offers excellent spatial resolution and some spectral information for inks on the surface or under one layer of papyrus, but the information content soon diminishes with depth.\n\nTransillumination\nImages obtained with white light transillumination are shown in Fig.\u00a04. Here, crosses on all four layers are clearly visible, although those in deeper layers are somewhat less clear than those in the top layers. No appreciable difference was observed when filters were used. Transillumination images displayed a large dynamic range (due to absorption by the papyrus, the majority of the images were very dark although the transilluminating light gave very strong responses from pinholes in the phantoms). The images were therefore enhanced using the Auto Equalise function of Gimp 2.8 (http://www.gimp.org), and show the structure of the papyrus as well as the crosses.\n\nFig.\u00a04\nImages obtained of all four phantoms (from left, crosses in: iron gall ink; carbon ink; red iron oxide and India ink) under transillumination with white light\n\n\nThis transillumination system was not optimised for this application, but gave substantially improved penetration compared to multispectral imaging. Future developments include a bespoke system with adjustable wavelengths which is anticipated to offer similar penetration but enhanced spectral information.\n\nOptical coherence tomography\nOCT images were initially obtained of all four phantoms using a clinical system at Duke University Eye Centre. OCT images show reflections from interfaces within an object as well as light scattered by microscopic structure so, because papyrus is a layered structure, these images were complex and difficult to interpret. Accordingly, further studies were carried out with a more flexible system at UCL.\nIt was found that, unless special care was taken to select part of the phantom where the papyrus sheets happened to be thinner than average, the papyrus attenuated the light and, therefore, the OCT signal so significantly that no convincing detail or structure of the papyrus could be seen. This was investigated further by calculating the attenuation coefficient of papyrus at this wavelength which was found to be approximately 17.5/mm. This is unusually high (compared with\u00a0~\u00a05/mm for skin [36]) and suggests that the intensity of light would be reduced by half after about 40\u00a0\u03bcm of papyrus. Equivalently, light passing through a single 300\u00a0\u03bcm thick sheet of papyrus, then reflecting off an interface and returning, would be expected to be reduced in intensity by a factor of 36,000. At shorter, visible wavelengths, this would be even greater.\nImages were generated of the uppermost cross in carbon ink, sliced to show the top surface of the phantom, and of the cross under one sheet of papyrus, sliced to show the level at which the cross would be expected (Fig.\u00a05). The uppermost cross was visible, but the cross under one sheet of papyrus was not, suggesting that the attenuation coefficient of papyrus at 1300\u00a0nm is far too high to image below even one sheet of papyrus.\n\nFig.\u00a05\nShowing the uppermost cross in carbon ink just under the surface of the phantom (left) and an image showing the location of the cross under one sheet of papyrus where no ink is visible\n\n\n\nX-ray micro computed tomography\nThe top half of all four phantoms, imaged simultaneously, can be seen in a surface rendered XMT image in Fig.\u00a06 with areas of maximum contrast corresponding to the iron-based inks highlighted in red. The physical construction of the phantoms can be seen particularly clearly. Examination of the 3D cross-sectional images showed that the iron ink could be reliably identified, but the carbon ink could not be detected. This suggests that XMT can be used to examine the physical construction of the artefact, and identify heavy metal-based inks, but not carbon-based inks.\n\nFig.\u00a06\nSurface-rendered X-ray micro computed tomography image showing the top part of all four phantoms, with iron ink highlighted in red\n\n\n\nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging\nSpectroscopy measurements were taken from parts of the phantom with the pXRF system where no ink was present and compared to those where ink was visible. Two \u201cmodes\u201d were available on the system used, which was on loan from UCL Institute of Archaeology: a \u201csoil\u201d mode and an \u201calloy\u201d mode. The soil mode was calibrated for calcium as well as most other elements which were expected, so this mode was used throughout.\nThe crosses corresponding to India ink and carbon ink were not detected. Both rely on carbon, which is a light element (atomic number Z\u00a0=\u00a06) and fluoresces at too low an energy for this system to detect. The lightest element which could be detected was phosphorus (Z\u00a0=\u00a015). The iron present in iron gall ink and red iron ink (Z\u00a0=\u00a026) was readily visible and could be distinguished from background through up to six layers of papyrus (additional layers of plain papyrus were placed above the phantom). Each additional layer of papyrus reduced the intensity of the fluorescence from iron by a factor of approximately 1.7 (Fig.\u00a07).\n\nFig.\u00a07\nThe concentration of iron as measured by the hand-held pXRF system against the number of sheets of papyrus. The best exponential fit is shown. The dotted line shows background plus two standard deviations above the background and is taken to be the detection limit\n\n\nX-ray fluorescence imaging was carried out at SSRL. The beam was scanned across the phantoms and the emitted fluorescence measured with an energy-resolving detector. The energy region of the K\u03b1 fluorescence line for each element of interest was identified, and the spatial distribution of the emitted X-ray intensity in this energy band was plotted as an image. Figure\u00a08 shows the images corresponding to iron for the four phantoms. The images of the iron-based inks show all crosses with similar contrast, indicating that the K\u03b1 fluorescence of iron was successfully identified in the ink at all depths. Crosses on the deeper layers were visibly less intense due to attenuation within the phantom. Images of the carbon based ink show little signal corresponding to iron, as expected, although a faint cross can be seen on the top left (only half of the phantom was scanned due to time restrictions).\n\nFig.\u00a08\nX-ray fluorescence images showing the presence of iron in the iron-based inks (from left, crosses in: iron gall ink; carbon ink; red iron oxide and India ink). Very faint XRF signals from iron can be seen in the phantoms with carbon based ink. Due to limited time resources, only half of the phantom containing crosses in carbon in was imaged\n\n\nCarbon K\u03b1 fluorescence is low energy (0.277\u00a0keV) and so is severely attenuated by absorption in air. The rapid scanning synchrotron system used here was, therefore, unable to resolve carbon in this geometry for several reasons: (1) the low X-ray fluorescence energy of carbon, (2) the detection limit of the detector used, and (3) the fact that the substrate is predominantly carbon. However, images of the carbon ink crosses were able to be resolved by imaging other elements. Weaker signals were seen from Ca, Ti, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga and As due to impurities in the dyes but, surprisingly, there was a very strong signal from bromine in the India ink phantoms. This may be due to an additive in the ink, most likely the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16H33(CH3)3N+Br\u2212) [37].\nXRF can detect heavy metals through a substantial thickness of papyrus. The pXRF system used here could detect iron-based inks through six sheets of papyrus but a more sensitive synchrotron-based system would be expected to show greater penetration still. The range of specific approaches which are available (from a hand-held system to a synchrotron) mean this is a flexible method.\n\nX-ray phase contrast imaging\nDue to time constraints, only the phantoms with crosses in red iron oxide and carbon were examined using X-ray phase contrast imaging. The small field of view (~\u00a02\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0cm) meant that only selected parts of the phantoms were imaged and images showing part of the red iron oxide cross on the surface of the phantom are shown in Fig.\u00a09a, b. The cross appeared strongest on the absorption image due to the attenuation of the iron in the ink. This image also clearly showed the fibrous structure of the papyrus (Fig.\u00a09a). The cross was also visible in an image of scatter width (Fig.\u00a09b), which was attributed to the refractive index of the ink differing from that of the papyrus. Some faint traces of contrast were seen from the carbon ink, but these were very faint and do not reproduce well.\n\nFig.\u00a09\na X-ray phase contrast absorption image, showing part of the red iron oxide cross on the top layer of papyrus. b X-ray phase contrast image of the same acquisition as a, but processed to show the scatter width\n\n\nThe laboratory-based X-ray phase contrast system used here was able to detect the iron inks and the structure of the papyrus. Moreover, there was some evidence that the carbon inks could be seen due to the change in refractive index. However, more assessment is needed to optimise the approach.\n\nTerahertz imaging and spectroscopy\nFigure\u00a010a shows THz images of the carbon ink at all four depths, demonstrating that ink on all four layers could be detected. A similar result was seen for the India ink cross, though this was less distinct. The iron-based inks were barely visible (Fig.\u00a010b). All four samples were scanned with a spatial resolution of 500\u00a0\u03bcm however, the maximum resolution, which is diffraction-limited, is around 100\u00a0\u03bcm. The images shown in Fig.\u00a010b are the peak to peak signal of the reflection from the first layer of each papyrus sample.\n\nFig.\u00a010\na The carbon ink crosses imaged at four depths corresponding to each layer using THz imaging. The first layer is on the bottom and gives the strongest contrast; the cross of the fourth layer is still visible but with lower contrast as the THz beam has passed through the preceding three layers and back again before being detected. b THz images of the uppermost cross of made with (from left to right) iron gall ink, carbon ink, red iron oxide, and India ink. This shows that carbon-based inks appear to provide more contrast than metallic-based ink when using THz for imaging\n\n\nTHz was able to penetrate multiple layers and was the only method which appeared to give better contrast for carbon-based inks than for iron-based inks.\n\nSummary of results\nSee Table\u00a01.Table\u00a01\nComparison of different imaging modalities\nImaging techniqueNumber of sheets through which iron-based inks can be recordedNumber of sheets through which carbon-based inks can be recordedTypical image acquisition timeTypical image processing timePixel/voxel sizeField of viewMultispectral imaging2220\u00a0min~\u00a01\u00a0h24\u00a0\u03bcm30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0cmTransillumination>\u00a03>\u00a0320\u00a0min~\u00a01\u00a0h24\u00a0\u03bcm10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0cmOptical coherence tomography00<\u00a010\u00a0s2\u00a0min2\u00a0\u03bcm10\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm (in depth)X-ray micro tomography>\u00a03Not visible18\u00a0h<\u00a02\u00a0h38\u00a0\u03bcm5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cmPortable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy6Not visible30\u00a0sNone~\u00a01\u00a0cm1\u00a0cmX-ray fluorescence imaging>\u00a03Not visible10\u00a0s1\u00a0min100\u00a0\u03bcm10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0cmX-ray phase contrast imaging>\u00a03Not visible10\u00a0min1\u00a0min100\u00a0\u03bcm2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0cmTerahertz130.1\u00a0s/pixel10\u201320\u00a0s100\u00a0\u03bcm4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0cm\nNote that for most of these parameters can be varied depending on the application, so these figures should be seen as indicative only\n\n\n\nDiscussionThe different imaging\u03c1 techniques all brought different advantages and disadvantages, so should be seen as complementing each other. Multispectral imaging provides excellent surface detail of both iron- and carbon-based inks with high spatial resolution, but limited penetration. However, this disadvantage is to some extent mitigated by the use of transmission imaging. Optical coherence tomography offered unexpectedly poor penetration due to the high optical attenuation coefficient of papyrus. The X-ray techniques were able to identify iron-based inks even when additional sheets of papyrus were added on top of the phantoms, but were unable to detect carbon-based inks. In particular, XMT provided exquisite images of the internal structure of the material. Furthermore, improved performance of X-ray phase contrast imaging would be expected if the system was optimised for this application. In particular, it would be interesting to see whether the scatter width image could show a signal from the carbon-based inks. An pXRF system optimised for the geometry and elements expected in cartonnage is likely to form a convenient and low-cost part of a multimodal approach.Terahertz imaging was, somewhat to our surprise, more able to detect carbon-based inks than iron-based inks. It is encouraging that THz appears to be sensitive to inks which are not visible with X-ray techniques. These results are supported by a previous THz study which was also able to read carbon inks on papyrus [38].Despite the different modalities being complementary, there are clear applications where certain modalities are likely to be preferred. For example, XMT should be used when the internal structure of cartonnage is required while multispectral imaging is recommended when only surface detail is of interest. However, a full examination of a complex piece of cartonnage is likely to require a multimodal approach, where each technique provides complementary information. This could place a significant barrier in the way of researchers in the cultural heritage sector who might not have access to a wide range of imaging techniques. In addition, given the different geometries and fields of view of the different techniques, a successful multimodal imaging approach will require sophisticated image registration to ensure that features on the different images are spatially aligned.If an existing instrument which was designed for some other application is repurposed for imaging heritage artefacts, its performance cannot be expected to be optimal. In particular, transillumination, phase contrast X-ray and THz imaging would be expected to give improved images if the instrumentation, acquisition or processing were optimised.Finally, the use of simple, predictable, test phantoms has allowed different imaging modalities to be objectively compared. This will inform future studies in which cartonnage will be imaged. It would have been challenging to carry out a speculative study such as this on original material, particularly across multiple institutions on different continents, due to issues involving the transportation of antiquities, including their fragility, and the legal frameworks that (quite rightly) restrict the sharing of these materials across borders.\nConclusionNo current single imaging technique can identify both iron and carbon-based inks at depths within cartonnage. In order to detect and ultimately read text within cartonnage a multimodal imaging approach is required, but this will, necessarily, be limited by cost, access to imaging systems, and the portability of both the system and the cartonnage. The additional challenges of imaging writing within ancient cartonnage compared to the test phantoms include a more complex geometry, overlying structures such as plaster, adhesives and paint, and the presence of mixtures of inks. It will, therefore, be important to begin by imaging the internal structure with XMT, which will assist with the interpretation of other imaging methods. Ideally, a combination of multispectral imaging techniques would then be employed for surface inks or paints, and X-ray fluorescence imaging for deeper iron-based inks (which would not necessarily require a synchrotron). At the moment, there cannot be confidence that deeper carbon-based inks can be detected, although optimised THz systems may allow this in future.An imaging approach based on low-cost and easily accessible methods would be necessary for widespread use in museums and archives. Such an approach might use multispectral imaging and pXRF to identify and clarify text on the surface layers and allow the constituents of inks to be identified. It is noted that there may be barriers to accessing these imaging modalities within the cultural and heritage sector, including associated costs, and building appropriate interdisciplinary networks.Our work leads us to believe that imaging could be used to identify whether text is present within mummy cartonnage. In some circumstances\u2014for example if iron-based ink is near the surface of cartonnage\u2014imaging may even allow the writing to be read, meaning that it may no longer be necessary to destroy these artefacts in order to read any text inside them. Future work will involve multi-modal imaging on actual mummy cartonnage since the use of phantoms has established that our approach is valid and may yield useful results for historians and related researchers, although issues remain regarding the ability of artefacts to travel to available imaging resources. Our work can also give curators and conservators some confidence that multiple complex imaging methods can be carried out safely without damaging the artefacts. The range of techniques used here will not be commonly available to Egyptologists or papyrologists and indicates that interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to be able to utilise available technologies in the understanding of ancient cultural heritage.\nFootnotes1Carbon ink was made by grinding soot into a fine powder, mixing to a paste with deionised water and then mixing into the binder.\u00a02Red iron oxide ink was made by grinding red earth (Aswan, Egypt) with a pestle and mortar, making the resulting powder into a paste with deionised water and then mixing in a binder of one part powdered gum Arabic (Kurdufan, Central Sudan) to two parts water.\u00a03Iron gall ink was made by soaking five oak galls overnight, then crushing them, boiling in deionised water and straining.
